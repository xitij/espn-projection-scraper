Dobbins in the second round of last year's draft, but it turned out to be a mistake to overlook a young back with a career 5.2 YPC (second-best in the NFL since he entered the league in 2018). Edwards racked up 852 yards and six TDs from scrimmage while pacing Baltimore's backfield in carries (144) and touches (153). Edwards has been in the 133-to-144 carry range each of the past three seasons, but with Dobbins out for the season, he figures to blow by that range in 2021. Edwards' miniscule role as a receiver (24 targets in 43 games) is concerning, but he'll get enough carries in a good offense to warrant flex consideration, especially in non-PPR leagues.",

Williams has the second-best YAC (4.1) and forced missed tackle rates (3.0) in this year's class over the past three seasons and was top-two in both categories in 2020. Williams has good size (5-foot-10, 212 pounds) and is an aggressive and explosive rusher with respectable receiving production (his 25 catches in 2020 were third-most in this class). Williams is one of the youngest backs in this class (21) but will immediately step into a consistent role next to starter Melvin Gordon. He may start slow, but Williams figures to progressively take on more work as the season progresses. He'll be worth of a mid-round pick in season-long leagues.",

During 13 full games the two backs played together, Hunt trailed in snaps (451 to 391) and carries (215 to 136), but led in routes (183 to 175) and targets (41 to 29). Interestingly, Hunt was RB11 in fantasy during four games Chubb was out, but RB13 during the 11 regular season games both played in full. Hunt's ceiling will continue to be limited as long as Chubb is healthy, but he's very effective (Top 8 in YAC all three seasons with 100-plus carries), busy as a receiver and working behind an elite offensive line. The 26-year-old is a flex option and arguably the best insurance policy in fantasy.",

        "seasonOutlook": "Gaskin was one of the bigger surprises of the 2020 season, as the 2019 seventh-round pick won the team's lead back gig in camp and went on to play 69% of the team's offensive snaps when active. He was RB8 in fantasy those weeks. Gaskin was held without a top-20 fantasy week in his first four games before finishing no lower than 17th in his final six games. Gaskin was competent as a rusher, but exceptional as a receiver, finishing seventh among RBs in receiving yards thanks to an 87% catch rate (second best) and 8.3 YPT (best). Miami's only notable RB acquisition this offseason was Malcolm Brown, so Gaskin remains locked in as lead back. The 24-year-old is a borderline RB2.",

The 2017 third-round pick broke out with a WR21 fantasy campaign in 2018 before leaping up to WR9 on the back of a league-high 11 TDs in 2019. The wheels fell off in 2020, however, as injuries limited him to five games. The 6-foot-4 perimeter weapon will immediately step in as the Giants' top WR and figures to handle a target share in the same 22-23% range that he saw with the Lions. The Giants' QB play remains a question mark as Daniel Jones enters a make-or-break third season, but Golladay has a path to solid volume and figures to be very busy near the goal line. Consider him a fringe WR2.",

That's decent production for most players but not for a player who averaged a 96-1,374-12 line during his first three seasons in the league (2014-16). Durability remains a major concern, as Beckham is averaging 9.8 games played over the past four seasons. Beckham turns 29 this year, and his target ceiling is capped a bit in Cleveland's run-first (albeit efficient) offense. Beckham should be valued as a WR3 but has the talent to leap back into the WR2 mix.",

Smith-Schuster peaked with a 111-1,426-7 receiving line and WR8 fantasy finish in 2018 before struggling with injuries and a Ben Roethlisberger-less offense in 2019. He bounced back to an extent last season, but it was a season only PPR's mother could love, as he caught 97 balls (seventh most) for 831 yards (36th). Smith-Schuster's 5.7 aDOT was second lowest among WRs, which led to a lowly 6.4 YPT (eighth lowest). He scored a career-high nine TDs, but his 5.8 OTD suggests he was way over his head. Smith-Schuster has a high PPR floor, but his targets could fall with Chase Claypool on the rise and Diontae Johnson in the mix. Consider him a WR3 and downgrade him in non-PPR.",

Anderson's role was much different than it was with the Jets, as he was used less as a vertical weapon (9.4 aDOT compared to 14.8 with Jets), which led to career-high showings in targets, receptions and receiving yards. The only problem area for Anderson was scoring TDs, as he found pay dirt only three times (his fewest since 2016). The 28-year-old is ticketed for a similar role in 2021 and very well could benefit from Sam Darnold's arrival, Curtis Samuel's departure and some regression to the mean in the TD department. Anderson is a fine WR3 target.",

Back in 2019, Sutton posted a 72-1,112-6 receiving line en route to a WR19 fantasy campaign. He was terrific after the catch (5.0 RAC), reliable (only two drops on 124 targets), and productive despite some bad TD luck (6 TDs, 7.2 OTD). During his first two seasons, Sutton ranked sixth in the NFL with 23 end zone targets. The presence of Jerry Jeudy, Noah Fant, KJ Hamler, Tim Patrick, Melvin Gordon and Javonte Williams may limit Sutton's upside, but the 25-year-old looked like a budding star before his injury. He's a WR3.",

In 2020, Andrews missed a pair of games, but still tied for third with eight top-10 fantasy weeks. The 26-year-old is one of Lamar Jackson's top targets and locked in as a top-five fantasy TE.",

The 2019 first-round pick posted a modest 32-367-2 receiving line in 12 games as a rookie before making the leap to a 67-723-6 line in 16 games in 2020. Hockenson finished no lower than fifth among TEs in fantasy points, targets, receptions and yardage, and no lower than 10th in routes, TDs and end zone targets. Detroit changed systems and QBs during the offseason, but also overhauled (not in the good way) at wide receiver. Hockenson's trajectory remains on the upswing at age-24 and, even in a rebuilding Detroit offense, he can be viewed as a solid fantasy TE1.",

Oh, and he's only 20 years old. Pitts is on the thin side (245 pounds) and a work in progress as a blocker, but that won't hinder his elite upside as a pass catcher. He'll immediately step in as Matt Ryan's No. 2 target behind Calvin Ridley. Yes, rookie TEs are rarely fantasy relevant, but if anyone can be the exception, it's Pitts. Consider him a mid-range TE1.",

        "seasonOutlook": "Jeudy was very busy as a rookie, appearing in all 16 of Denver's games while ranking 21st among WRs with 112 targets. The 2020 first-round pick's efficiency did not match his volume, as he dropped eight passes (second most) and his 46% catch rate ranked 86th out of 87 qualified WRs. Jeudy was utilized as a vertical threat (his 14.5 aDOT ranked eighth), but 25% of balls thrown his way were off target (eighth highest). He ended up as WR45 in fantasy with only two top-30 fantasy weeks. The talented 22-year-old will be a candidate for a second-year leap, but more volume isn't a lock with Courtland Sutton back and KJ Hamler, Tim Patrick and Noah Fant also involved in Denver's run-heavy scheme led by an unproven Drew Lock. Jeudy will be a risky mid-round pick, but he has upside.",

The 2020 second-round pick had his ups-and-downs but showed his ceiling with a 7-110-3 receiving line on 10 targets in Week 5. He went on to finish eighth among WRs with nine TDs (he scored two more in the team's playoff game) and 23rd at the position in fantasy points. Claypool saw at least six targets in 11 of 17 games, including 10 of his final 11. The 6-foot-4 vertical weapon will need to steal some targets away from JuJu Smith-Schuster and Diontae Johnson, but he's likely just getting started. The 23-year-old is on the WR3 radar with upside for more.",

The LSU product is a versatile and physical 6-foot, 201-pound wideout with a laundry list of assets, including good strength, speed, hands, as well as ball-tracking and tackle-breaking ability. He opted out of the 2020 season, but he's only 21 years old and broke out at the young age of 19. The Bengals had a third WR on the field on 82% of their offensive plays in 2020 (2nd most in NFL), so playing time won't be an issue even with Tyler Boyd and Tee Higgins in the fold. Also, consider that since 2009, five of the six WRs picked Top 6 in the draft were top-30 fantasy WRs as rookies. Chase has elite upside and is immediately on the WR3 radar.",

The 28-year-old took his game to another level back in 2019, totaling a career-high 33 TDs while finishing second in fantasy points among QBs. He was well on his way to an even better season in 2020, with 12 scores and sitting second in fantasy points in four games prior to suffering a season-ending ankle injury in Week 5. Prescott returns to arguably the league's best supporting cast, powered by the likes of Amari Cooper, CeeDee Lamb, Michael Gallup, Ezekiel Elliott and a very good offensive line. Prescott is, at worst, a solid weekly starter and has the upside to lead the position in fantasy points.",

That includes a 159-1005-7 rushing line in 2020 that was actually a step back from what he produced during his MVP run in 2019. Jackson also accounted for 370 fewer passing yards, 10 fewer TDs and three more INTs, while regressing from first to 10th in fantasy points. The return to earth was expected after the historic and unsustainable 2019 showing. The 24-year-old is expected to throw the ball more in 2021after the team added Rashod Bateman, Tylan Wallace and Sammy Watkins to a group that also includes Marquise Brown and Mark Andrews . Jackson should be valued as a mid-range QB1 with upside for more.",

        "seasonOutlook": "Davis signed with the Falcons during the offseason. The 28-year-old's NFL ride has been interesting, as the 2015 fourth-round pick battled to hang on to a roster spot in San Francisco, Seattle and Chicago before joining Carolina as Christian McCaffrey's primary back up during the 2019 season. McCaffrey's injury-plagued 2020 vaulted Davis into the fantasy spotlight and he ended up 13th among RBs in touches and yardage while finishing 12th in fantasy points. Davis' efficiency was unimpressive (3.9 YPC, 5.3 YPT) and his role was reduced down the stretch, but a sizable workload in the pass game (his 70 targets ranked fifth) led to the fantasy success. Atlanta didn't draft a back, so Davis is expected to be the lead runner in 2021. He could sneak into the RB2 mix, but is best-viewed as a low-ceiling flex.",

Harris made his 2020 debut in Week 4 and went on to rack up 743 yards and a pair of TDs on 142 touches. He impressed as a rusher (5.0 YPC, 2.0 YAC) despite facing 7.4 box defenders per carry (second highest), but was uninvolved as a receiver (eight targets). Harris was RB24 in fantasy during 10 active weeks, managing one weekly finish better than 19th (11th). The 24-year-old will share carries with the likes of rookie Rhamondre Stevenson and J.J. Taylor, and James White is back as the team's primary receiving back. Harris is on the flex radar, especially in non-PPR leagues.",

The 2016 first-round pick flashed his upside often but battled injuries during his first four NFL seasons, missing 22 games during that span. He was well on his way to a breakout 2020, sitting eighth at WR in fantasy points with a 53-879-8 receiving line and a league-high 11.4 YPT prior to being suspended for the season's final five weeks (he'll complete the suspension in Week 1 this season). Fuller has plenty of competition for work (DeVante Parker, Jaylen Waddle, Mike Gesicki), but he's the best of the bunch and should be in the vicinity of the 6-to-7 targets per game he's averaged throughout his career. Fuller is a good WR3 target and could jump even higher if QB Tua Tagovailoa makes a second-year leap.",

The 2014 first-round pick delivered the goods in Houston in 2020, averaging a career-high 24% target share, ranking 12th at the position with a 9.7 YPT and handling a career-high nine end zone targets. Despite some concussion concerns, Cooks has missed a grand total of three regular-season games over the past six seasons. With Will Fuller gone, 27-year-old Cooks is Houston's clear No. 1 WR, but his value could take a hit with Deshaun Watson's future in doubt. Cook has the look of a WR2 with Watson but will be more of a WR3 if Tyrod Taylor is at the controls.",

The 2016 second-round pick peaked with a pair of top-20 fantasy campaigns in 2018-19 and was well on his way to a similar showing in the first half of 2020. Boyd was WR9 in fantasy during Joe Burrow's 10 starts, but Burrow went down with a torn ACL in Week 11 and injuries limited Boyd to three more full games the rest of the season. Boyd joins Tee Higgins and Ja'Marr Chase to form one of the league's best WR trios and all three will be busy in Cincinnati's WR-friendly scheme. Boyd doesn't find the end zone much (one season with more than five TDs), but the 26-year-old is a good bet for his fourth consecutive season averaging a target share above 20%. He's a fine WR3.",

The versatile Shenault produced 600 yards and five TDs on 58 receptions and added 91 yards on 18 rushes. His 6.0 aDOT was third lowest among WRs, but he made up yards with his post-catch ability (5.2 RAC ranked 18th). The 22-year-old played an expanded role late last season (8.3 targets per game after Week 13) and is a strong bet for a second-year leap with coach Urban Meyer and QB Trevor Lawrence added to the fold. Shenault is a good flex target, and a full-on breakout is possible.",

In the offseason that followed, Dallas changed coaching staffs and drafted CeeDee Lamb in the first round. As expected, Gallup's usage and production took a hit. Despite finishing second among all WRs in routes (601), Gallup was limited to a 59-843-5 line and a WR38 fantasy showing (including three weekly finishes better than 34th). Dak Prescott's Week 5 season-ending injury is notable, but Gallup was averaging 5.4 targets per game and was WR33 in fantasy for Prescott's starts. He averaged 7.2 per game and was WR38 in his final 11 weeks of action. The 25-year-old is a good player in a great and high-volume, though crowded, offense. Prescott's third priority is best-valued as a flex.",

He ended up pacing all tight ends in snaps and routes, and finished no lower than seventh in targets (108), receptions (72), yardage (670) and end zone targets (nine). Thomas' season started slowly despite a generous target share with Dwayne Haskins under center, but he bloomed down the stretch with Alex Smith. Perhaps his 19% target share will decrease with ultra-conservative Smith gone and Curtis Samuel added at WR, but that could easily be offset by more big plays and scoring opportunities courtesy of gunslinging QB Ryan Fitzpatrick. Thomas is well positioned for another TE1 campaign and the 29-year-old should be on your radar in the middle rounds.",

The reigning Heisman Trophy winner, Smith put up 1,856 yards and 23 TDs during his dominant 2020 campaign. The big knock on the Alabama star is size (6-foot-1, 175 pounds), but his ball skills are unmatched in this class and he has the versatility, speed, quickness, separation ability, route-running prowess and hands (six drops on 298 targets over the past three seasons) to emerge as a high-volume, elite NFL wide receiver. Smith joins Jalen Reagor as the Eagles clear-cut top two WRs and, while it's yet to be seen if Jalen Hurts will develop into a capable NFL starter, we at least know Smith will be a full-timer out of the gate. He's a flex option with obvious upside for more.",

Samuel managed five full games, averaging a hefty 25% target share (8.2 per game) while also handling 4% of the team's carries. His 30-356-1 receiving line was good enough for the 17th-most fantasy points among WRs. As a second-round rookie in 2019, Samuel put up 697 yards and four TDs from Week 10-17 and was WR9 in fantasy during that stretch. He kept it up in the playoffs with 229 yards on 16 touches. Samuel is primarily used near the line of scrimmage (7.7 aDOT in 2019, 2.4 in 2020) and is a terror with the ball in his hands (career 9.5 RAC). A weapon as both a receiver and rusher, Samuel shouldn't struggle for touches in Kyle Shanahan's offense. He's a good flex target.",

Rodgers completed a league-best 71% of his passes and paced the NFL with 48 passing TDs. Considering his age, declining rushing production and probable statistical regression to the mean -- he finished top-five in C%, YPA and TD% in 2020 after finishing no better than 15th each of the previous two seasons -- Rodgers is unlikely to repeat as the No. 2-scoring fantasy QB. Of course, he's finished as a top-10 QB in every season in which he's appeared in at least 15 games, so we can consider him a fairly safe QB1.",

The drama comes after a bizarre 2020 campaign in which Wilson opened the season with six top-7 fantasy weeks in eight games before managing zero after Week 8. Wilson's hot start was enough for his ninth-consecutive top-11 fantasy campaign (he's also finished top-3 in pass TDs each of the past four seasons), but Pete Carroll's penchant for a run-first offense figures to cap Wilson's pass volume moving forward. Wilson is now 32 years old, but still adds value with his legs (fourth among QBs in rushing yards in 2020). Consider him a mid-range QB1.",

The 2020 sixth-overall pick accounted for 36 TDs and 10 INTs in 15 games, which helped him to a top-10 fantasy week in 60% of his starts. That trailed only Aaron Rodgers and Kyler Murray for tops at the position. Herbert's numbers certainly benefited from a very fast-moving and high-volume offense, but new OC Joe Lombardi's past offenses leaned heavily on the pass. Herbert looks like the real deal and he does enough with his legs to supply him with a high floor and a massive fantasy ceiling. Even with an underwhelming supporting cast, the 23-year-old is a viable QB1 with upside for more.",

The 2019 first-round pick impressed with a TE16 fantasy campaign as a rookie before making the leap to TE8 in 2020. Fant finished no lower than seventh at the position in targets, receptions and yardage. The only stumbling block for Fant has been finding paydirt, as he's scored three TDs in both seasons (3.4 OTD and four end zone targets in 2020). Perhaps that will improve this season, but Denver's run-first scheme, unsettled QB situation and crowded WR room could limit Fant's output. Despite the roadblocks, Fant appears to be the real deal, ranking first at TE in RAC as a rookie and fourth in 2020. The 23-year-old is a back-end TE1.",

        "seasonOutlook": "Thomas is back as the Saints' No. 1 WR, but he's expected to miss a few games to open the 2021 season due to injury. This comes after Thomas suffered through an injury-plagued 2020 campaign that saw the veteran wide receiver post a 40-438-0 receiving line in seven regular-season outings. It's a disappointing turn of events after a 2019 campaign in which he set the NFL single-season reception record while posting an incredible 149-1,725-9 receiving line on 185 targets. Thomas had finished four consecutive seasons as a top-seven fantasy WR before last year's debacle. The Saints' QB situation is a question mark for the first time in Thomas' career (and Drew Brees' retirement is sure to hurt his efficiency), but a hefty target share (once healthy) shouldn't be a problem for Thomas, considering the Saints' underwhelming situation behind him on the depth chart. The 28-year-old is a fine mid-round target as he'll be in the WR1 mix when on the field.",

After barely playing as a second-round rookie in 2018, Chark broke out with a 73-1,008-8 receiving line and 17th-place fantasy finish in 2019. Injuries (three missed games) and weak QB play (Chark's 27% off-target rate was third most among WRs) struck in 2020, limiting Chark to three top-30 fantasy weeks. Chark is still only 24 years old and a candidate for a rebound season with a new coaching staff led by Urban Meyer and a new QB (Trevor Lawrence) in house. The speedy, 6-foot-3 perimeter receiver will need to fend off Laviska Shenault Jr. and Marvin Jones Jr. for No. 1 duties, but it's safe to value him as a fringe WR3.",

Chark and Laviska Shenault Jr. in the fold in Jacksonville. Where Jones has shined is near the goal line, as he's scored nine-plus TDs in four seasons since 2013, including exactly nine in three of his past four campaigns. He's finished no lower than 20th in end zone targets and no lower than 25th in aDOT among WRs during that span. With rookie QB Trevor Lawrence likely to experience growing pains out of the gate, Jones is best valued as a borderline flex option in 12-team leagues.",

        "seasonOutlook": "Davis signed with the Jets after four seasons with the Titans. The 2017 fifth-overall pick underwhelmed during his first three seasons, despite heavy usage, but progressed a bit in 2020 with a 65-984-5 receiving line on 94 targets. It was easily his most efficient season, as he caught 71% of his targets despite a career-high 12.2 aDOT. That helped him to 10.7 YPT (seventh best at WR) and 2.7 YPRR (fourth). Davis is ticketed for an every-down role in New York, but he has yet to post a single top-25 fantasy campaign and will now be working in a potentially run-first and low-scoring scheme with a rookie QB and a crowded WR room (Jamison Crowder, Elijah Moore, Keelan Cole, Denzel Mims). The 26-year-old is a borderline flex in deeper leagues.",

        "seasonOutlook": "Henderson is entering his third NFL season and, with Cam Akers out for the season, he'll be competing with newcomer Sony Michel for the Rams' lead back gig. It’s a big opportunity for Henderson, as the 2019 third-round pick barely saw the field while behind Todd Gurley II as a rookie (184 yards on 43 touches) and then fell behind Akers last season. Akers missed most of Weeks 2-7 and also Week 16 last season. Henderson split backfield duties with Malcolm Brown during those seven games, racking up 96 carries and 16 targets on 210 snaps, compared to 54 carries and 18 targets on 227 snaps for Brown. Henderson was efficient and delivers a trio of top-11 fantasy weeks, but the low passing-game usage limited him to the 20th most fantasy points during the seven weeks (Brown was 42nd). Henderson can leap to the RB2 radar, but he'll first need to beat out Michel for lead back duties. The more-likely outcome is a two-headed committee that places both in the weekly flex discussion.",

        "seasonOutlook": "Mostert is eyeing a bounceback 2021 campaign after injuries limited him to 120 touches in eight games last season. Mostert was fantasy's No. 16 RB during those eight outings and, granted he's only handled 282 career carries, but his 5.6 YPC is tops in the NFL since he entered the league in 2015. Mostert's usage has been fairly consistent. He handled 51% of the carries and 8% of the targets during the final eight games of 2019 and was at 51% and 8%, respectively, during the six games he played in full in 2020. The 29-year-old doesn't see much receiving work (career 48 targets), has durability concerns (has appeared in more than 11 regular season games once) and will face competition from third-round rookie Trey Sermon. Mostert will be on the RB2/flex radar early on, but expect Sermon's role to progressively increase. ",

        "seasonOutlook": "Baltimore's offensive scheme is about as unfriendly to WRs as they come, and Brown has felt the wrath during his first two NFL seasons. The 2019 first-round pick saw a big uptick in usage last season, playing 78% of the snaps, and handling 25% of Baltimore's targets (10th highest among WRs) and 38% of its air yards. He was targeted at least six times in 12 of 16 regular-season games. Despite the heavy usage - and a respectable eight TDs - Brown finished 35th at WR in targets, 42nd in receptions and 40th in yards. He was WR36 in fantasy, and 14th was his best weekly finish. Baltimore may throw more in 2021, but he's a candidate for fewer targets with Rashod Bateman, Sammy Watkins and Tylan Wallace added to the mix. Brown is a flex option.",

The 2014 second-round pick had handled at least 8.1 targets per game in five consecutive seasons and, despite Odell Beckham Jr. missing 10 games, Landry's targets fell to 6.7 per game in 2020. His WR33 fantasy finish was the worst of his seven-year career and came after five consecutive top-18 campaigns. Even more concerning, Landry had 32 targets in six full games with Beckham (5.3 per game) and was WR40 in fantasy (which would've been worse if not for a passing TD). The 28-year-old is a short-range target who doesn't score much in a run-first scheme. Especially with Beckham back, Landry is likely to cap out as a flex option.",

        "seasonOutlook": "Samuel reunited with HC Ron Rivera and OC Scott Turner, who coached him during his first three seasons in Carolina, when he signed with Washington during the offseason. Samuel progressively improved from 126th to 49th to 36th in fantasy points during that span and had his best campaign (25th) in 2020, totaling 848 yards on 76 receptions and 200 yards on 41 carries. Interestingly, Samuel actually saw his routes, targets and TDs dip last season, but a huge increase in efficiency and rushing usage led to the big fantasy campaign. In fact, Samuel finished with just 13 fewer fantasy points than new teammate Terry McLaurin. Samuel will be no lower than third in line for targets behind McLaurin and Logan Thomas in what will be a much more explosive offense with Ryan Fitzpatrick. Samuel is a fine WR3/flex.",

        "seasonOutlook": "Williams is entering his fifth NFL season but has yet to deliver a top-30 fantasy campaign. The seventh-overall pick back in 2017, Williams has been a mainstay opposite Keenan Allen the past three seasons but has struggled for target volume (he has yet to clear 91 in a season) and consistent TD production (10 TDs in 2018, but seven total the past two seasons). Williams has settled in as a de facto situational deep threat, having ranked no lower than ninth in aDOT and 11th in YPR each of the past three seasons. The 26-year-old was limited to four top-35 fantasy weeks last season. Perhaps Williams will get rolling in Los Angeles' new scheme and in Justin Herbert's second season, but he's best drafted for your bench in the late rounds.",

        "seasonOutlook": "Brown re-signed with the Buccaneers after his tumultuous year-plus out of the league came to end when he joined the team in Week 9 last season. Including a trio of playoff showings, Brown appeared in 10 games along with Chris Godwin and Mike Evans and averaged 5.9 targets (16% share). His fantasy point total during the span extrapolated over 16 games (177.6) would've ranked 38th during the regular season. A WR-high 24% of his targets were screens, which limited Brown's yardage, but he didn't drop a ball and was great after the catch (5.8 RAC). The 33-year-old is third in line for targets behind Evans and Godwin in a high-scoring offense, so he's certainly on the flex radar in 12-team leagues.",

        "seasonOutlook": "Michel was traded to the Rams after playing only 31% of the Patriots' offensive snaps across three seasons after being selected in the first round of the 2018 draft. Some of that is injury related (including seven missed games in 2020), but it's also a product of scheme (he's a non-factor in passing situations with 40 career targets). Michel has run the ball pretty well and that includes a 5.7 YPC (second best) and 2.4 YAC (third best) on 79 carries in 2020. Despite already reaching 200-plus carries in two seasons, Michel has yet to post a top-30 fantasy campaign due to his lack of targets. The 26-year-old will share work with Darrell Henderson in Los Angeles, but he certainly has a path to a career-high workload in his first contract year. Michel is worth a look in the middle rounds, as he has RB2 upside.",

The Alabama star is arguably the most explosive WR this year's class, as he sports elite speed, athleticism and playmaking ability. He's on the small side (5-foot-10, 182 pounds) and totaled only 131 targets in three seasons with the Crimson Tide, but his 15.3 YPT, 3.7 YPRR, 10.0 RAC and 81% catch rate during that span are all best in this year's rookie class. Waddle has the ability to play inside or out (he aligned in the slot 71% of the time at Alabama) and figures to begin his career inside with Will Fuller V and DeVante Parker on the perimeter. Waddle might be limited for targets a bit early on, but his talent and pedigree makes him worth a mid-round pick.",

Ruggs appeared in 13 games and played a healthy 555 snaps, but he was held to a 26-452-2 receiving line on 43 targets, adding 49 yards on nine carries. He posted two weekly fantasy finishes better than 46th. Ruggs has world class speed at 4.27 and was utilized as a vertical threat as a rookie (16.9 aDOT), but 3.3 targets per game (no more than five in a single game) simply won't cut it. Las Vegas' shaky WR depth chart gives Ruggs a real shot to emerge as the team's No. 1 WR, so a breakout is likely -- if he can translate his skill set to the pros. Grab him for your bench.",

        "seasonOutlook": "Fournette was a star for the Buccaneers during last season's Super Bowl run, but his season was one of ups-and-downs as he shared the backfield with Ronald Jones II. The two played 12 \"full\" games together, with Fournette handling more snaps (419 to 296) and targets (56 to 23), but with Jones leading in carries (132 to 114). Tampa Bay re-signed Fournette during the offseason, so combined with his expanded role in the playoffs, the 26-year-old is a good bet to lead this backfield in 2021. That said, Jones is the more effective rusher and Giovani Bernard was added as a passing-down option, which is certain to limit Fournette's upside. Fournette has two-career top-10 fantasy campaigns, but is best-viewed as a RB3/flex option in 2021.",

        "seasonOutlook": "Drake's value went the wrong direction during the offseason, as he's headed from feature back duties in Arizona to a complementary role behind Josh Jacobs in Las Vegas. Last season, Drake finished no lower than 12th among RBs in snaps (594), carries (239), rushing yards (955) and TDs (10), while ranking second in the NFL in carries inside the 5 (21) and third in OTD (13.4). He won't come close to that usage with the Raiders. Drake was limited to 31 targets in 2020 but totaled 139 the prior two seasons in Miami and Arizona. Though his receiving efficiency hasn't been good (career 5.5 YPT on 226 targets), Drake figures to return to a more prominent role in that department, with Jacobs handling most of the carries and goal-line work. Drake is a PPR flex and very good insurance policy.",

        "seasonOutlook": "The Bills selected Moss in the third round of the 2020 draft and immediately inserted him as a near-equal contributor to a backfield committee that also included Devin Singletary. Moss appeared in 13 regular season games and totaled 576 yards and five TDs on 125 touches. The limited role in Buffalo's pass-heavy scheme limited Moss to two weekly fantasy finishes better than 24th and one better than 15th. In 14 games together, Moss held the edge over Singletary in carries (119 to 117), but trailed in snaps (482 to 397) and targets (43 to 24). Moss was extremely effective during his time at Utah, but the 23-year-old remains stuck as, at best, the leader of a committee. Moss should be on benches in most formats. ",

Gordon was effective as a rusher (4.6 YPC, 1.9 YAC) and has now scored at least nine TDs in five-consecutive seasons. On the flip side, Gordon wasn't as involved as expected as a receiver (45 targets is his fewest since 2015) and struggled badly in that area (RB-worst 3.5 YPT). Durability remains a concern (he's missed at least two games in four of six NFL seasons) and the 28-year-old now has legitimate competition via second-round pick Javonte Williams. Gordon may lead the unit early on in the season, but figures to struggle for consistent RB2 numbers. He's a fine flex target in drafts. ",
