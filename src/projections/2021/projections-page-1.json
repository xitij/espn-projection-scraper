McCaffrey was fantasy's No. 2-scoring RB in 2018 before scoring an absurd 156 more points than any other back in 2019. He was on track for another dominant campaign last season, scoring exactly two TDs while posting 25-plus fantasy points in all three of his appearances. Even after the lost season, McCaffrey is one of the league's few remaining every-down backs and will benefit from Matt Rhule and Joe Brady's RB-friendly offense. McCaffrey is a candidate for 400 touches and locked in as the top asset in fantasy football. ",

Despite missing two games, Cook ranked second at the position in carries, touches, scrimmage yards and TDs. His 22 carries inside the opponent's 5-yard line topped the NFL. Cook has finished top-three in fantasy points per game each of the past two seasons, but durability continues to elude him. He's missed at least two games in all four of his NFL seasons. Of course, when you're performing at an elite level, some missed time is tolerable. Cooks remains a top-three fantasy RB in a Vikings' offense that finished fifth in the NFL in TDs last season.",

Barkley was the feature back, as expected, out of the gate, handling 15 carries and nine targets while playing 88% of the snaps in Week 1. That aligned with his usage during his first two NFL seasons. Barkley paced all RBs in yardage and fantasy points as a rookie in 2018 and ranked third in yardage and fourth in fantasy points during his 12 full games in 2019. There are suddenly a lot of mouths to feed in New York, but Barkley is one of the few backs in the league who will push for 25 touches every week. The 24-year-old remains an elite RB1.",

Kamara's role in Sean Payton's offense is about as clear and consistent as they come, as he's finished between 171 and 194 carries each of the past three seasons while posting reception totals of 81, 81, 81 and 83 during his four NFL campaigns. Kamara has yet to finish as season lower than fifth at RB in targets, receptions or receiving yards and has finished top-two in total TDs during three of four seasons. Kamara's outlook is clouded by Drew Brees' retirement, but his combination of usage and talent positions him for a run at his fifth-consecutive top-10 fantasy campaign. ",

He's now led the league in carries, rushing yards and rushing TDs each of the past two seasons. He finished both seasons as a top-five fantasy back despite totaling 55 targets during the span. The lack of receiving work does lead to the occasional bust week, as Henry finished outside the top-30 RBs four times last season. Henry is now 27 years old, but has shown no sign of slowing down, having finished no lower than ninth in YAC each of the past four seasons. He's a solid RB1 in PPR and an elite play in non-PPR formats.",

Kelce has paced the field in five consecutive seasons, ranking no lower than fourth at the position in routes, targets, receptions and yardage each year. As if he wasn't already dominating enough, Kelce set career high marks in catches (105), receiving yards (NFL-record 1,416), TDs (11) and fantasy points (313) in 2020. He posted a top-five fantasy week in 13 of 15 appearances, finishing lower than ninth just once. In addition to benefiting from Mahomes and pass-heavy Andy Reid, the 31-year-old is so good that he's worth considering in the first round.",

Including a pair of playoff games, Adams was targeted at least nine times in 14 of his 15 full games and posted a ridiculous 130-1,471-20 receiving line during that span. He reached double-digit TDs for the fourth time in five seasons and posted a top-10 fantasy week in a position-best 57% of his regular-season outings. Adams averaged a career-high (and league-high) 34% target share, and he's now been at or above 30% each of the past three seasons. The 28-year-old hasn't appeared in 16 games in a regular season since 2016, but he's so good when active that we can deal with some missed time. Aaron Rodgers' top weapon is the best WR in fantasy.",

The issue, of course, was a split season that saw Elliott post the third-most fantasy points during Dak Prescott's five starts (top-13 every week) before plummeting to 24th (one weekly finish better than 12th) the rest of the way. Prescott and Dallas' elite offensive line are back and healthy for 2021, which positions Elliott, who paced the NFL with 22 carries inside the 5-yard line last season, for a big rebound. The 26-year-old could prove to be a steal late in the first round of drafts.",

        "seasonOutlook": "Taylor enters his second NFL season as the clear lead back in Indianapolis. The 2020 second-round pick's rookie season got off to a very underwhelming start, as despite a Week 1 season-ending injury to Marlon Mack, Taylor was limited to one top-12 fantasy week in his first 10 games. The light went on from that point forward, however, as he finished 15th or better in each of his final six games. Taylor's efficiency was outstanding, as his 5.0 YPC ranked ninth, his 88% catch rate first and his 7.3 YPT second among backs. The return of Mack and presence of Nyheim Hines on passing downs will limit Taylor's ceiling a bit, but he's a 22-year-old super-athlete who was already third in rushing yards and sixth in fantasy points as a rookie. Taylor is a solid RB1.",

During 10 active weeks, Ekeler racked up 933 yards and was fantasy's No. 8-scoring RB despite finding the end zone only three times. Even including the weeks he was sidelined, Ekeler finished fifth among backs in receptions and receiving yards for the second-consecutive season. Ekeler has still yet to clear 132 carries in a single season, but his heavy volume and elite efficiency as a receiver makes him one of the few backs in the league who could reasonably push for 90 receptions. The 26-year-old is a mid-to-back-end RB1.",

        "seasonOutlook": "Jones re-signed with Green Bay during the offseason and returns as the high-scoring Packers' feature back. The 26-year-old has been a top-five fantasy back each of the past two seasons, ranking no lower than 15th in carries and no lower than 12th in targets among RBs during both campaigns. The hyper-efficient Jones has finished three of four seasons with a YPC above 5.4 and his career-best 2.4 YAC ranked second in 2020. Durability is a slight issue (he's missed at least two games in three of his four NFL seasons), but not enough to knock him more than slightly on draft day. With Jamaal Williams out and AJ Dillon as the team's No. 2 back, Jones may lose some goal line work, but perhaps gain snaps and receiving work. Jones is locked in as a solid RB1. ",

Chubb missed four games in 2020, but was very productive in 11 full regular season games with Hunt. He racked up 184 carries and 19 targets and only three RBs scored more fantasy points during the span. Aside of a rough Week 1, Chubb finished the other 10 games he played in full as a top-22 fantasy back. We know Chubb is a terrific rusher (his career 5.23 YPC and 2.28 YAC both rank second among qualified RBs), but we also saw an all-important boost in targets down the stretch last season (16 in his final four games). The 25-year-old will operate behind arguably the league's best offensive line and is a top-10 fantasy RB in all formats.",

His target shares during active weeks have been between 22% and 24% and his air-yard shares between 36% and 39% each of the past four seasons. He finished as a top-10 fantasy WR in 40% of his games last season (third best) and was worse than 30th only 20% of the time (second best). Hill continues to break math as it pertains to TDs (53 career offensive TDs, 31.4 OTD) and efficiency (career 2.5 YPRR), but the speedy, explosive and heavily utilized 27-year-old has shown no sign of slowing down. Last season's No. 2-scoring fantasy WR has a legitimate shot to take the top spot away from Adams in 2021.",

        "seasonOutlook": "Gibson is entering his second NFL season following an impressive rookie campaign in which he averaged 4.7 YPC on 170 carries. This after he totaled 33 carries in college. The third-round pick found the end zone 11 times (only six RBs had more), which helped him to five top-10 fantasy weeks (only five RBs had more). Gibson is a candidate for TD regression to the mean (7.0 OTD), but there is a lot of room for more touches after he only played 47% of the snaps during 13 full games. The 23-year-old is still pretty raw as a rusher and he's a very capable receiver as a former wide receiver. Assuming he takes on an expanded role in 2021, Gibson can be viewed as a good RB2 with massive upside.",

        "seasonOutlook": "Harris was scooped up by Pittsburgh with the 24th pick of April's draft. Standout RB prospects from Alabama are nothing new, but Harris is a bit of a unicorn in that he's huge (6-foot-2, 230 pounds) and an outstanding receiver with a large catch radius (43-425-4 receiving line in 2020). Absurdly elusive for his size, Harris' 3.1 forced missed tackle rate is third best in this year's class during the past three seasons. Harris is severely lacking speed, but his combination of size, strength, tackle breaking, elusiveness and receiving ability supplies him with a high ceiling. He'll immediately slot in as the undisputed lead back. Pittsburgh's offensive line isn't as good as in year's past, but volume is king and Harris could push for 20 touches as soon as Week 1. He's immediately a mid-range RB2 and sports RB1 upside.",

        "seasonOutlook": "Diggs' first season in Buffalo was a giant success, as the 2015 fifth-round pick set new career-high and league-leading marks in targets (168), receptions (127) and receiving yards (1,535). Diggs' 29% target share was a new career-high, and his third-place finish in fantasy points marked his first season better than 10th. Diggs was solid in the first half of the season but exploded for four top-five weeks in his final seven games. Diggs also appeared in 16 regular season games for the first time in his six-year career. The 27-year-old is Josh Allen's top target in one of the league's highest-scoring and pass-heaviest offenses. Expect Diggs to deliver another strong WR1 campaign in 2021.",

        "seasonOutlook": "Hopkins didn't miss a beat in his first season in Arizona, posting his fourth consecutive top-five fantasy campaign and fifth since 2015. Hopkins finished second among WRs in targets, receptions and receiving yards. He saw at least seven targets in 15 of 16 games and has now handled a target share of at least 26% and air-yard share of at least 34% each of the past seven seasons. Despite the consistent usage, Hopkins was more boom/bust than usual, finishing as a top-10 fantasy WR in 50% of his appearances (second best), but outside the top 30 in 44% (15th best). Hopkins may be nearing the end of his prime, but the 29-year-old still figures to have another year or two of elite play in the tank. He's a solid WR1.",

Ridley is now Matt Ryan's unquestioned top option, with the 26-year-old's top competition for targets rookie TE Kyle Pitts. Arthur Smith's run-oriented scheme could cut Ridley's volume, but the 2018 first-round pick should still deliver fringe top-5 WR numbers.",

The oversized perimeter threat finished 11th among WRs with 131 targets and sixth in routes (577), receiving yardage (1,303) and TDs (10). Metcalf's 15 end zone targets ranked third in the NFL, and his career mark of 34 in that category is five more than any other player since he entered the league. Metcalf finished 2020 seventh in fantasy points but didn't show quite the high ceiling we expected, as his three top-10 fantasy weeks ranked tied for 17th. Nonetheless, Metcalf is only 23 years old and one of the best athletes in the game. He's a solid WR1 with elite upside.",

The 2019 second-round pick missed Weeks 2-3 with an injury, but during the other 15 weeks of the season, he was the fourth-highest-scoring WR in fantasy. Brown averaged a hefty 28% target share (37% air-yard share) during 15 active weeks (which included one playoff game). Brown has finished top-three in YPRR and top-eight in YPT, RAC and TD% during both of his NFL seasons, and it's unlikely that we've seen the 24-year-old's best NFL season. Julio Jones is now in the mix, but Corey Davis and Jonnu Smith are gone, so Brown still has a path to a huge target share. Consider him a solid fantasy WR1 with a high ceiling.",

The LSU product hit double-digit targets in five of his final six games and only three wide receivers scored more fantasy points after Week 2. Jefferson's efficiency matched his top-end usage, as his 11.0 YPT and 2.8 YPRR both ranked second at the position. The 22-year-old won't be short on targets in Minnesota's run-first but high-scoring scheme and makes for a solid WR1 target.",

Mixon was busy those weeks, handling 81% of Cincinnati's carries and 12% of the targets while sitting 10th among RBs in fantasy points per game. For perspective, he handled 75% of the carries and 8% of the targets in 16 games while finishing as RB13 in 2019. Mixon is only 24 years old and has now delivered solid RB2 numbers in three-consecutive seasons. An early-down feature back with a rising target share (especially with Giovani Bernard gone) and a healthy Joe Burrow under center, Mixon's outlook is on the upswing. He's a good RB2 target with RB1 upside.",

Despite being handed a feature role out of the gate, \"CEH\" didn't live up to expectations, managing only two top-10 fantasy weeks in 13 appearances. Edwards-Helaire's efficiency was pedestrian across the board and he dealt with some bad TD luck (five TDs, 7.8 OTD). On the plus side, the 22-year-old remains in a great spot as the high-scoring Chiefs' lead back and, unlike last year, he won't cost you a first-round pick. Consider him a RB2 option and post-hype sleeper for RB1 numbers.",

His 11 top-10 fantasy weeks trailed only Travis Kelce (14) and were three more than the next-closest TE. Waller improved in every key fantasy category, but the biggest boost was in the TD department. After scoring three times in 2019 (3.7 OTD), he jumped to nine last season (7.8 OTD). Waller has finished no lower than fifth at TE in snaps, routes, targets, receptions and yardage each of the past two seasons. He'll be in the same system (Jon Gruden) with the same QB (Derek Carr) and with another unproven WR room. The 28-year-old is a top-three fantasy TE.",

The Ohio State product flashed with a 58-919-7 receiving line in 14 games as a rookie before leaping to an 87-1,118-4 line in 15 games last season. McLaurin's per-target numbers took a hit last season, as the presence of conservative Alex Smith and Kyle Allen led to an aDOT drop from 13.8 in 2019 to 9.6 in 2020. New QB Ryan Fitzpatrick (top 10 in aDOT each season from 2015-19) should allow the speedy McLaurin more vertical targets and likely more scoring opportunities (six end zone targets last season ranked 64th). The 25-year-old is primed for his best NFL season and very much on the WR1 radar.",

Now 29 years old, Allen's play could see a dip in the near future, but he remains the clear No. 1 target in an ascending Justin Herbert-led offense. Consider Allen a fringe WR1.",

        "seasonOutlook": "Robinson has yet to have the benefit of playing with a top-end QB, and yet he continues to deliver the goods. The 2014 second-round pick has put together back-to-back top-10 fantasy campaigns, finishing no lower than sixth in targets and routes during each of the past two seasons. Robinson's 1,250 receiving yards in 2020 were his most since 2015 and, though he had some bad luck in the TD department (6 TDs, 7.8 OTD), his 15 end zone targets were third-most in the NFL. It's not a lock, of course, but Chicago's QB situation could be much better this season if first-round pick Justin Fields proves to be the real deal. Even if he doesn't, Andy Dalton may be an improvement on last year's situation. Robinson is in his prime at 28 years old and is one of the game's top talents. He's a borderline WR1 in fantasy.",

Lamb posted a 29-433-2 receiving line and was WR11 in fantasy during Dak Prescott's five starts but managed a 45-502-3 line and was WR35 in 11 games after Prescott's knee injury. The good news is that Prescott - as well as Dallas' elite offensive line - is back healthy for 2021, which sets up Lamb for a big leap in his second season. The 2020 first-round pick and Dallas' primary slot WR is likely to see a boost from his 18% rookie-season target share in one of the league's fastest-moving offenses. Consider the 22-year-old a WR2 with upside.",

The good news is that he was still heavily-targeted (7.9 per game), his efficiency was great (top-5 at TE in YPT and RAC for the third straight season), and his overall fantasy production was good (top-three in fantasy PPG for the third consecutive season). Believe it or not, Kittle has never cleared five TDs in a single season, but the 27-year-old makes up for it with heavy volume and yardage totals. He remains a top-three fantasy TE.",

        "seasonOutlook": "It's not often that an undrafted free agent posts an RB1 campaign as a rookie, but Robinson made it happen in 2020. The Illinois State product replaced Leonard Fournette as the team's feature back and went on to finish seventh among RBs in both scrimmage yards and fantasy points despite missing two games. Robinson was a factor as a rusher (sixth in carries) and receiver (10th in targets) while playing 70% of the offensive snaps. Robinson is a candidate for TD regression to the mean (10 TDs, 5.9 OTD), but with Travis Etienne out for the season, the second-year back remains positioned for a substantial offensive role. Consider Robinson a mid-range RB2.",

Montgomery's season started slowly, as he managed only top-12 fantasy week in nine games, but he took advantage of a huge workload and very light schedule after returning from injury in Week 12 and went on to post six-consecutive top-8 weeks to finish the season. Montgomery ranked 17th in touches (14.3 carries, 3.0 targets per game) and 25th in fantasy points during three weeks with a healthy Tarik Cohen, but was top-four in both categories (16.6 carries, 5.0 targets) once Cohen went down. Cohen is back and Damien Williams and rookie Khalil Herbert were added, so combined with a much tougher schedule, Montgomery figures to return to earth. He's a mid-to-back-end RB2.",

        "seasonOutlook": "Sanders returns as the feature back in Philadelphia after an injury-plagued, but productive 2020 campaign. The 2019 second-round pick missed nearly five full games, but averaged 14.1 carries and 4.6 targets per game during the 11 weeks he was a full go. He was RB11 in fantasy points those weeks and his 5.3 YPC for the season was second-best among backs. Sanders is only 24 years old, a capable receiver (he ranked seventh in receiving yards and second in YPT among RBs as a rookie) and won't be short volume in a Nick Sirianni scheme that has leaned heavily on the run the past two seasons. Sanders is a good RB2 with upside for more behind a good (and now healthy) Eagles' offensive line.",

He's appeared in 15-plus games each of the past three seasons and finished all three as a top-14 fantasy WR. Woods' usage has been incredibly consistent (target shares of 24%, 25%, 23% and 24% during the four Rams seasons), and he has finished no lower than third in snaps, 11th in routes, 13th in targets and 11th in receptions at the position during any of the past three campaigns. Woods was over his head in the TD department in 2020 (8 TDs, 4.9 OTD) but also adds value as a rusher (60 carries over the past three seasons). The 29-year-old is a low-ceiling but solid WR2.",

        "seasonOutlook": "Evans' first season with Tom Brady led to third-best fantasy finish of his seven-year career (11th). Evans' production was very reliant on TDs, however, as his 13 scores were a career high and fourth most at the position. Evans' 109 targets (24th) and 18% target share (49th) were career lows. Believe it or not, Evans has finished only one season better than ninth in fantasy points. Of course, at 6-foot-5 and having finished no lower than ninth in end zone targets every season of his career, Evans will rarely be short on TDs. Consider that in 10 \"full\" games with Chris Godwin and Antonio Brown, Evans led the trio with 73 targets (20% share) and his 16.1 fantasy PPG during the span extrapolated over 16 games would've ranked 10th during the regular season. The 28-year-old is a mid-range WR2.",

        "seasonOutlook": "Cooper is undoubtedly one of the league's top WR talents, so it may surprise you to know that the six-year NFL vet has yet to finish a season better than 10th in fantasy points. Volume is the primary culprit, as he's never exceeded a 23% target share or 130 targets in a single season. Despite the capped ceiling, Cooper has finished as a top-21 fantasy WR in five of six seasons, including each of the past three. The 27-year-old was fifth among wideouts in Dak Prescott's five starts last season and figures to pick up where he left off in Dallas' high-volume, loaded offense in 2021. Cooper is a solid WR2 with the potential for a career-best season.",

        "seasonOutlook": "Swift enters his second NFL season as the clear lead back in Detroit. The 2020 second-round pick was limited to 114 carries in 13 games as a rookie, but was busy as a receiver, ranking no lower than 13th in targets, receptions, receiving yards, catch rate and YPT. Interestingly, Swift handled at least four targets in 11 games, but never had more than five in a single outing. Swift scored on an unsustainable eight of 114 carries as a rookie, but with newcomer Jamaal Williams second in line for touches, he's a strong bet to offset TD regression to the mean with a much larger workload in his second season. Even in a rebuilding Detroit offense, Swift has the look of a strong fantasy RB2.",

Carson ranked 11th in rushing yards those weeks after finishing fifth each of the previous two seasons. He also handled a career-high 3.8 targets per game. At worst, Carson has delivered good RB2 numbers each of the past three seasons and Seattle is expected to lean more on the run under new OC Shane Waldron. The 26-year-old figures to miss a game or two, but he's an underrated RB2.",

The 2014 UDFA posted a 74-925-14 receiving line, and his 20 end zone targets were three more than any other player. Thielen disappeared at times (six games with single-digit fantasy points) but delivered a high ceiling with six top-10 fantasy weeks (tied for third most) in 15 games. He has now finished three of the past four seasons as a top-10 fantasy WR. Thielen is now 31 years old, but Minnesota's lack of WR depth positions him to handle nearly one-quarter of the targets again this season. Consider Thielen a solid WR2.",

That would've been good enough for a WR15 finish during the regular season and was a step down from his 86-1,333-9 line on 120 targets in 14 games in 2019. In 10 \"full\" games with Mike Evans and Antonio Brown, Godwin saw 71 targets (19% share), but was limited to 125 fantasy points (12.5 PPG extrapolated over 16 games would've ranked 28th last season). Godwin is one of the league's best WRs (he's finished top-10 in catch rate and YPT each of the past two seasons), but his target ceiling is a bit limited with Evans and Brown back in the Buccaneers' spread-it-around attack. Consider the 25-year-old a back-end WR2.",

Of his 265 fantasy points, 123 (46%) came in three games, as did eight of his 10 TDs. Lockett scored 51 more fantasy points than any other WR those weeks, but he was WR32 with nine finishes of 40th or worse the other 13 weeks. Despite the inconsistent production, Lockett averaged a career-high 8.3 targets per game (25% share) and has finished as a top-16 fantasy WR each of the past three seasons. He's also finished no lower than sixth in catch rate, TDs and end zone targets each of the past two seasons. Seattle may lean more on the run in 2021, but Lockett and DK Metcalf are the team's clear top two weapons and assured generous target shares. The 28-year-old is a fringe WR2.",

        "seasonOutlook": "It's not inaccurate to say Johnson \"broke out\" during his sophomore campaign in 2020, but it was certainly a bizarre showing by the 2019 third-round pick. On the plus side, Johnson did an excellent job getting open, and his 144 targets ranked seventh at the position. In 12 regular-season games he played in full, Johnson averaged a massive 11.2 targets per game and was the No. 4-scoring fantasy WR. On the other hand, Johnson left three games injured, led the NFL with 12 drops and his overall efficiency was atrocious (his 61% catch rate ranked 65th and his 6.4 YPT 82nd among 87 qualified WRs). The 24-year-old is Ben Roethlisberger's top target in Pittsburgh's pass-first offense, so the heavy volume will keep him in the WR2 mix. If his efficiency improves, Johnson could vault even higher.",

Despite the remarkable consistency, Kupp fell from fantasy WR4 in 2019 to WR26 in 2020. The primary culprit? Predictable TD regression to the mean. Kupp scored 10 TDs (5.4 OTD) in 2019 but managed only three (3.6 OTD) in 2020. Kupp's efficiency was otherwise pretty similar to years past, and he has now finished no lower than 13th at WR in receptions, RAC and catch rate each of the past two seasons. Kupp, who actually out-targeted Robert Woods 134 to 128 in 16 games together last season, is one of the game's top slot WRs and gets a boost from the team's QB upgrade to Matthew Stafford. Consider the 28-year-old a good WR3 in PPR.",

        "seasonOutlook": "Jones was traded to the Titans after spending his first 10 seasons with the Falcons. The trade comes after Jones' streak of six consecutive top-seven fantasy seasons came to an end in 2020. Injuries were, of course, the culprit, as Jones missed seven full games and the better part of two others (he missed a total of four the prior six seasons). The good news is that Jones was still dominant when healthy. In seven games he played in full, Jones posted a 45-700-3 receiving line and was fantasy's No. 3 WR. He posted a career-high 11.2 YPT, and he has now finished top-5 in YPRR in eight consecutive seasons. There are concerns, though, as Jones is 32 years old and likely to play second fiddle to A.J. Brown in Tennessee's run-first offense. Perhaps Jones has another elite season in the tank, but he's best valued as a mid-range WR2.",

The 2018 first-round pick posted a similar line (66-1,193-4) in a new offense last season, though his usage was quite different. Moore handled more deep targets, which vaulted his aDOT from 11.2 to 13.6 and his YPT from 8.7 to 10.0 (ninth highest in the NFL) but crushed his catch rate (64% to 55%) and reception total. Moore also struggled with drops (eight) and continues to underwhelm in the TD department (10 in three seasons), but he sees plenty of volume (25% target share last season) and is one of the game's better young playmakers. The 24-year-old, who very well could get better QB play with Sam Darnold under center this season, should be valued as a fringe WR2.",

Seriously. Aiyuk posted a 60-748-5 receiving line and added 77 yards and two TDs on six carries during 12 active weeks, which was enough for the ninth-most fantasy points among WRs during that span. Aiyuk, who averaged 12.6 targets per game during a five-game stretch late in the season, may see a dip in usage with Deebo Samuel and George Kittle (among others) now healthy, but the 2020 first-round pick certainly looked the part as a rookie. Consider him a WR3 with upside.",

The 2020 second-round pick played 81% of the offensive snaps and handled a 21% target share (31% air yards) those weeks. Only 20 WRs had more fantasy points during that span despite Joe Burrow missing half the season. Higgins' best weekly finish was ninth in Week 10, but note that of his seven top-30 fantasy weeks, five came in his final seven full games with Burrow. The 6-foot-4 perimeter threat will have his QB back in 2021, but his upside took a bit of a hit when Cincinnati selected Ja'Marr Chase with the fifth pick of April's draft. Even with Chase and Tyler Boyd involved, 22-year-old Higgins still has a path to 7-8 targets per game and is a fine WR3 target.",

Jacobs finished eighth at RB in fantasy points 2020, ranking no lower than seventh in carries (273), rushing yards (1,065), TDs (12), and carries inside the 5-yard line (18). However, his efficiency plummeted across the board relative to an impressive rookie campaign. The 2019 first-round pick's heavy role as a rusher and near the goal line won't disappear, but he's simply not much of a factor as a receiver (career 5.5 YPT on 73 targets) and, even before Drake arrived, he showed a low ceiling, posting only three top-10 fantasy weeks (18 RBs had more) in 2020. The 23-year-old is an uninspiring mid-to-back-end RB2.",

His career 4.8 YPC is strong, but is inflated by a league-high rate of runs against light boxes over the past two seasons. Edmonds ranked no lower than seventh at RB in receptions, receiving yards and TD catches last season, which helped him to a career-best 25th-place finish in fantasy points. He's played more than two-thirds of Arizona's snaps in only two career games, but came up big in both with a 29-touch, 150-yard, 3-TD effort in 2019 and a 28-touch, 88-yard showing in 2020. With Drake out and James Conner in as the team's lead rusher, Edmonds figures to see only a slight or perhaps moderate increase in workload. He's a flex option in PPR.",

Kansas City's overhauled offensive line should cure the pass-blocking woes that plagued the team during the Super Bowl loss and Mahomes will be working in the Chiefs' extremely pass-heavy scheme with the likes of Tyreek Hill and Travis Kelce at his disposal. The former league and Super Bowl MVP should be the first QB selected in your fantasy draft.",

The 25-year-old ranked no lower than sixth among QBs in pass attempts, completions, passing yards, passing TDs, completion percentage and YPA. He also continued to deliver the goods with his legs, scoring at least eight rushing TDs for the third consecutive season. Buffalo operated the league's second pass-heaviest offense in 2020 and that philosophy doesn't figure to change much as long as Allen is under center. The 25-year-old has cemented himself as an elite fantasy QB.",
