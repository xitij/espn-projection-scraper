Barkley was a workhorse as a rookie, racking up 261 carries (second-most among running backs) and 119 targets (third-most), while pacing the position in routes (458), scrimmage yards (2,028) and fantasy points (386). Barkley finished worse than 13th at the position in fantasy points in only two weeks. He was on the field for 83 percent of the Giants' snaps, handled 75 percent of the designed runs and took on 21 percent of the targets. That workhorse usage isn't expected to change in what could be an even run-heavier offense in 2019. Barkley is the top asset in fantasy.",

He finished 10th among backs in rushing attempts (219) and was first in targets (124), receptions (107) and receiving yards (867). McCaffrey had at least five receiving touchdowns for the second year in a row. He improved his yards per carry from 3.7 to 5.0 and his catch rate from 73 percent to 86 percent. The 23-year-old does it all and is well worth the early-first-round fantasy investment.",

The former third-round pick finished top-eight among backs in snaps (628), touches (275), scrimmage yards (1592), offensive touchdowns (18) and fantasy points (354). Kamara has yet to clear 200 carries in a season, but he has caught 81 passes in both of his NFL seasons and saw a significant uptick in work near the goal line last season (his 14.5 OTD ranked second in the league). Kamara's role won't change much with Latavius Murray added to replace Mark Ingram II. The 23-year-old back remains a solid RB1 option.",

That's led to a league-high 868 carries despite Elliott having missed eight games during that span. Elliott's game reached a new level last season as he easily reached career highs in targets (94), receptions (77) and receiving yards (567). Elliott led all backs in touches (381) and was second in scrimmage yards (2,001). His underwhelming usage near the goal line remains a concern (his 10 carries inside the 5 ranked 17th last season). Nonetheless, Elliott is a young, high-end talent set for a ton of volume. He should be one of the first players off the board in every draft.",

An injury cost him all but 43 snaps in 2017, and inefficient play in a weak offense limited him to only two top-10 fantasy weeks (24 backs had more) in 2018. Johnson's yards per carry plummeted to 3.64, his YAC to 1.44 (seventh-worst among running backs) and his catch rate to 66 percent (second-worst). On the plus side, Johnson ranked top-five at the position in snaps (714) and touches (308), which allowed him his third top-10 fantasy campaign in four seasons. The 27-year-old workhorse is expected to retain a hefty role in new coach Kliff Kingsbury's offense. An intriguing bounce-back candidate, Johnson is worth a look near the first/second-round turn.",

A longtime NFL workhorse, Bell ranked first among running backs in snaps (3,449), fourth in carries (1,229), third in rushing yards (5,336), fourth in rushing touchdowns (35), first in targets (390) and first in receiving yards (312) from 2013-17 despite missing 18 of 80 possible games. Bell, who has appeared in all 16 regular-season games once in his career, saw his efficiency take a dip in 2017, but pacing the position in rushes and receptions was enough to help him post his third top-three-overall fantasy season in four years. Jets coach Adam Gase's tendency to pass near the goal line (NFL-low 23 carries inside the 5 during his three seasons in Miami) could cost Bell some touchdowns, but the former Steeler won't have trouble generating big volume in an improving offense. He's a solid RB1.",

He has topped the position in OTD both seasons. Finally attached to a quality quarterback for a full season, Hopkins caught a career-high 70 percent of his targets in 2018. Hopkins has managed a massive 35 percent target share over the past two seasons. That could drop some with a healthy Will Fuller V and Keke Coutee in the mix, but Hopkins will still rank at or near the top of the position in the category. The sure-handed 27-year-old remains an elite fantasy asset.",

Thanks, in part, to super-accurate Drew Brees, Thomas has posted a catch rate of at least 72 percent during each of his three NFL seasons. Thomas has yet to reach double-digit touchdowns and has never cleared seven end zone targets in a season, but his elite efficiency and hefty target volume in the Saints' high-scoring offense is plenty enough to allow top-end fantasy production. He's a solid first-round target.",

Incredibly, Adams ranked in the top 18 among wide receivers in all but one week last season (27th in Week 4) aside from the one week he missed. In addition to catching 13 touchdowns (second most), Adams ranked fourth at the position in routes (618), fourth in targets (164), fifth in receptions (111) and sixth in receiving yards (1,386). Adams has hauled in 35 touchdowns over the past three seasons, which trails only Antonio Brown for most in the league. Adams has done this damage despite missing at least one game three of the past four seasons. The 26-year-old soaked up a massive 30 percent target share last season and has little competition for targets again in 2019. He's a fine choice in the middle of the first round.",

Incredibly, Jones' yards per target has ranked inside the top 20 wide receivers all eight seasons of his career. Despite an unlucky 2017 season in the touchdown department (3 TDs, 8.4 OTD), Jones predictably regressed to the mean and found paydirt eight times (8.0 OTD) in 2018. He finished fourth in fantasy points and hasn't finished a season worse than seventh since 2013. Jones is 30, but his game hasn't slipped, and a role that allowed a position-best eight top 10 fantasy weeks in 2018 is unlikely to change. He's a rock solid top 5 fantasy wideout.",

Though his play came back to earth a bit in 2018, Beckham ranked top 8 at the position in fantasy points per game for the fourth time in five seasons. Baker Mayfield's new No. 1 target is a strong bet to blow by 1,000 receiving yards for the fifth time in six seasons. The 26-year-old is a midpack WR1 with elite upside.",

Fantasy's No. 19 scoring receiver as a rookie in 2016, Hill climbed to eighth in 2017 and to first in 2018. Though Hill's usage has progressively increased, he has made his hay with outstanding efficiency. He paced all wide receivers with an 11.5 YPT in 2017 and finished fifth at 10.9 last season. He also has ranked top 12 in YPR and RAC both seasons, while actually reaching a career high 14.7 aDOT last season (eighth highest). The versatile Hill has ranked second among wideouts in carries during each of his three seasons and has added four rushing and five return touchdowns along the way. Hill is a mid-range WR1 with upside to again pace the position in fantasy points.",

Smith-Schuster should be able to handle it considering he's fresh off arguably the best second season for a second-year wide receiver in league history. Smith-Schuster paced all wide receivers in pass routes (662) and finished no lower than seventh in targets (167), receptions (111) and receiving yards (1,383). Smith-Schuster has scored seven touchdowns during each of his two NFL seasons, though his 8.3 OTD and 13 end zone targets in 2018 suggest he was a bit unlucky in that department. Smith-Schuster's targets might not rise significantly in 2019, but that's only because he was already a huge part of the offense. Incredibly still only 22, Smith-Schuster's best days still could be ahead of him. He's a solid WR1.",

The 24-year-old workhorse missed two games but still ranked fourth among backs in snaps, touches and scrimmage yards. He has paced running backs in fantasy points per game and top-10 fantasy weeks each of the past two seasons. Assuming there are no lingering injury red flags, Gurley remains an elite fantasy back and should be drafted in the first round.",

As incredible as that achievement is, he did this after already leading all tight ends in fantasy points each of the previous two seasons. Since missing his rookie season with a knee injury, Kelce has finished a season no lower than eighth at the position in receptions, no lower than sixth in receiving yards, no lower than 12th in touchdowns and no lower than ninth in yards per target. The three-time No. 1 fantasy tight end handled 26 percent of Kansas City's targets last season and should be in that range again in 2019. The 29-year-old is your top option at the position and worth a look in the second round of your draft.",

The last season in which he didn't finish as a top 5 fantasy wide receiver was 2012. Brown's touchdowns figure to take a dive this season after he found the end zone a career-high 15 times last season despite a 9.6 OTD. In the five previous seasons, Brown averaged 10.4 scores per season (9.0 OTD) and he figures to be in that range in 2019. The 31-year-old receiver will, of course, step in as Derek Carr's clear top target and should be near the top of the league in targets. He remains a terrific WR1.",

Mixon quietly ended up fourth at the position in rushing yards (1,168), sixth in both touches (280) and scrimmage yards (1,464), and 10th in fantasy points (243). The Bengals' offensive line remains a problem area, but 22-year-old Mixon is a workhorse back positioned well for another step forward in his third season. Consider him a fringe RB1.",

Conner picked up where his predecessor left off, handling 81 percent of the team's carries and 13 percent of the targets prior to suffering an injury in Week 13. During those 13 weeks, Conner put up 1,368 scrimmage yards and 13 touchdowns, which helped him to the fifth-most fantasy points among running backs. Conner's efficiency was solid and, unlike Bell, he benefited from getting many carries inside the opponent's 5-yard line (15, third-most). With Bell now in New York, the 24-year-old Conner returns as the Steelers' clear feature back. He's a back-end RB1.",

Cook has yet to emerge as a consistent fantasy threat, but did post the seventh-most fantasy points at the position after Week 12 last season, which aligned both with his return to full health and Minnesota's move to a run-first offense. Minnesota is expected to operate a run-heavy scheme in 2019, and Cook has minimal competition for touches. He's a breakout candidate and strong RB2.",

In fact, he has been on the field for 91 percent of the team's pass plays and has handled a hefty 28 percent target share. Allen has finished no lower than 13th at the position in targets, receptions, receiving yards and fantasy points during each of the past two seasons. If there's a concern area, it's touchdowns, as Allen hasn't scored more than six in a season since his rookie campaign in 2013. Allen's 5.4 OTD last season suggests he was fortunate to even reach six scores. Allen is in his prime at age 27 and one of the game's most effective receivers. Philip Rivers' top target is a safe back-end WR1.",

Once he took over as the lead back in Week 7, Chubb handled 80 percent of the Browns' designed runs and 10 percent of the targets, and only seven backs scored more fantasy points. For the entire season, Chubb averaged 5.2 YPC (10th-highest at the position), including 2.41 after contact (seventh-best), and he averaged 0.53 fantasy points per snap, which was fourth-highest among backs. Chubb will open 2019 as Cleveland's clear feature back, though a limited role as a receiver and the return of Kareem Hunt around midseason limit his upside a bit. Chubb is best viewed as a strong RB2 in Cleveland's improved offense.",

        "seasonOutlook": "Johnson was one of the youngest players selected in the 2018 draft, but that didn't stop the Auburn product from making an immediate impact. Despite playing only 51 percent of the snaps, Johnson ranked 14th among running backs in fantasy points prior to suffering a season-ending injury in Week 11. Johnson averaged 5.4 YPC (fifth-best) and caught 84 percent (seventh-best) of his 38 targets. Johnson will defer some touches to C.J. Anderson this season, but his averages of 12.5 carries and 4.0 targets per game after Week 1 last season will suffice to allow him RB2 production. Plus, there's room for more if he continues to play at a high level and with Theo Riddick gone. Johnson is a solid RB2 and breakout candidate.",

The 24-year-old back has already missed 11 games and has seen his yards per carry fall from 3.9 in 2017 to 3.3 (fifth-worst) in 2018. Though, in his defense, Fournette has dealt with a large number of stacked boxes and horrific quarterback play. On the plus side, an extensive workload near the goal line (19 carries inside the 5 in 21 games) and good receiving efficiency (82 percent catch rate, 8.4 YPR) have helped him to two straight seasons finishing top-12 in fantasy points per game. Fournette's Trent Richardson-like efficiency woes are a concern, but the addition QB Nick Foles and massive volume he receives keep him in the RB1 discussion and offer hope for a breakout season.",

The 2014 fourth-round pick paced the position in fantasy points in 2015, finished sixth in 2016 and ranked ninth in the 13 weeks he was active and healthy in 2017. Freeman's efficiency has been good, but where he really stands out is volume near the goal line. He rushed for 29 touchdowns from 2015 to 2017, thanks to 41 carries inside the opponent's 5-yard line (second-most). He finished top-five in the category all three seasons and scored six touchdown receptions in that span. Tevin Coleman is gone, which helps solidify the 27-year-old's standing as a solid RB2 with RB1 upside.",

Gordon maintained a substantial (albeit slightly reduced) share of the team's carries, and saw an uptick to 6.1 targets per game. That helped offset a bizarre drop in usage near the goal line; Gordon carried the ball inside the 5-yard line a total of 31 times during the 2016 and 2017 seasons but only four times in 2018. The goal-line usage is a concern, but Gordon is still in his prime at age 26 and is positioned for 300-plus touches in one of the league's better offenses. He's a solid RB1.",

In fact, he never fell below a 16 percent share in a single game and was fantasy's No. 9 wide receiver from Week 9 on. Cooper's boost in volume coincided with improved efficiency (he caught a career-high 71 percent of his targets and averaged a career-best 9.5 YPT), which is enough to make the 25-year-old a strong WR2 with top-10 upside.",

He has ranked above the 85th percentile in YPR four of the past five seasons. Hilton's only concern area is touchdowns, as he has never managed more than seven scores in a single season and hasn't caught more than six since 2014. Hilton has ranked outside the top 30 wide receivers in end zone targets during each of the past two seasons.

The Iowa product also ranked first at the position RAC (9.7) and was third in targets (136), receptions (88), fantasy points (259) and YPR (15.6). The only area where Kittle was truly underwhelming was in the scoring department, as he managed only five touchdowns (5.8 OTD) and seven end-zone targets. The future is bright for the 25-year-old Kittle, who will sustain a massive target share in the 49ers' improving offense. Scoop him up in the second or third round of your draft.",

He paced all tight ends in snaps (949), routes (550) and targets (156), while ranking top-four in receiving yards (1,163), touchdowns (eight) and end-zone targets (nine) last season. After struggling in the area during his first four seasons, Ertz has scored exactly eight touchdowns in back-to-back seasons. The 28-year-old is an elite, high-floor fantasy option who could defer some targets to DeSean Jackson and Dallas Goedert and still post a top-three fantasy season. He'll cost you a second- or third-round pick this season.",

The Alabama product lacks top-end speed, but is quick, elusive and strong. Jacobs broke one tackle for every 6.1 touches last season, which was best among backs who attended the combine. Jacobs has the skill set to quickly step in as a three-down back in the pros and, aside from deferring some work to Jalen Richard in passing situations, he figures to play that full-time role right out of the gate. Jacobs shouldn't have trouble pushing for 250 touches as a rookie and should be viewed as an RB2 in season-long leagues.",

The oversized back rushed for 12 scores (third-most) thanks to 13 carries inside the 5 (fourth-most). Despite playing a situational role most of the season, Henry's 238-yard, four-touchdown effort in Week 14 vaulted him into a larger role down the stretch. He was the top-scoring fantasy back by 17 points from that point on. Henry has been very efficient as a rusher (top-three in YAC each of the past two seasons) but has yet to clear 15 receptions in a season. He's expected to take on the largest role of his career in 2019, but that doesn't figure to mean much of an uptick in targets. That limits him to RB2 territory, but upgrade him in non-PPR.",

Carson posted 247 carries (seventh-most) for 1,151 yards (fifth-most) and nine scores (seventh-most) in 14 games as the lead back in Seattle's run-heavy offense. Carson averaged 2.29 yards after contact (11th-best) and, though he played a minimal role as a receiver, caught all but three of his 23 targets. Seattle's run-heavy scheme will be back in 2019, and Carson's terrific second season gives him the leg up on Penny for the bulk of the backfield touches. Carson's limited receiving role caps his upside a bit, but he'll touch the ball enough to allow fringe RB2 numbers and should be upgraded a bit in non-PPR.",

That was indeed the case, as Mack's YPC jumped to 4.66 and allowed him 908 yards on 195 carries. Mack appears to be an effective NFL rusher, but he has yet to make much of an impact as a receiver. He was held to 26 targets and posted an ugly 65 percent catch rate (second-worst among backs) last season. The Colts' high-scoring offense will help Mack produce RB2 numbers, but his limited receiving work caps his fantasy ceiling.",

Jones has missed four games in each of the past two seasons but has averaged a healthy 5.5 YPC during both campaigns. Despite playing only 51 percent of the snaps, Jones posted a trio of top-10 fantasy weeks and ranked 13th at the position in fantasy points during the 11 weeks in which he wasn't out or injured last season. With a new coaching staff in place, Jones is the favorite to lead a committee with Jamaal Williams this season. Jones will be positioned for around 200 carries and a modest receiving role, which should allow for solid RB2 numbers.",

Tom Brady's top target was limited to one top 10 fantasy week but finished only one of 12 outings worse than 30th, making him the second-safest bet for a top-30 week behind only Davante Adams. Edelman is averaging a massive 9.4 targets per game over the past five seasons and reached eight targets in nine of 12 games in 2018. Durability is the notable drawback as he has missed 45 of 160 possible regular-season games (28 percent) since joining the team in 2009. Edelman is now 33, but following Rob Gronkowski's retirement, he's ticketed for a gigantic offensive role. Consider him a strong WR2 option.",

Thielen posted eight top 10 fantasy weeks, which tied for most in the league, though he ended up seventh in fantasy points at season's end after Minnesota switched offensive coordinators and to a run-heavy offense down the stretch. Thielen has never cleared 10 end zone targets in a season, and Mike Zimmer's commitment to establishing the run could limit his upside a bit, but the 28-year-old has proven to be one of the best in the business. He's a strong WR1.",

During the seven full games Cooks, Robert Woods and Cooper Kupp played together last season, Cooks handled a strong 23 percent target share (7.7 per game) and ranked ninth in fantasy points.

Primarily a short-area target, Diggs' 10.0 YPR was sixth lowest and his 6.9 YPT 16th lowest at the position.

During the seven full games Woods, Brandin Cooks and Cooper Kupp played together last season, Woods paced the team with a 24 percent share (7.9 per game) and ranked 11th in fantasy points. Woods ranked second among all receivers in snaps (996) and was top 10 in touches (105) and scrimmage yards (1376). The concerns with Woods are touchdowns (he has never cleared six touchdown receptions or eight end zone targets in a season) and durability (he has missed at least two games in four of six NFL seasons). Nonetheless, he's the No. 1 receiver in Sean McVay's high-scoring offense and thus a solid WR1.",

Mahomes exploded onto the fantasy scene with 12 top-10 fantasy weeks en route to finishing as the top-scoring QB by 62 points over second-place Matt Ryan. Mahomes paced the league in passing touchdowns (50) and was second in passing yards (5,097), while adding 272 yards and two scores rushing. Entering his third season, Mahomes looks like the next great NFL quarterback -- and should be the top QB off the board in all drafts -- but history suggests we should expect a substantial statistical dip. Daunte Culpepper was the last to repeat as the No. 1 fantasy quarterback, and that was way back in 2003-04.",

Williams barely played in the first half of the 2018 season, but Kareem Hunt's release led to a huge opportunity for him. He didn't disappoint, producing 352 yards and six touchdown on 60 touches in Weeks 14-17. Only two backs scored more fantasy points in the stretch. It's fair to be a bit suspicious of the now-27-year-old Williams after the small sample of success, but he's positioned well as the favorite to be the lead back in Andy Reid's high-scoring and running-back-friendly offense. There's some risk here, but if Williams fends off Carlos Hyde and Darwin Thompson and earns 15-plus touches per game, he'll be a quality RB2 with RB1 upside.",

Following a slow start to his career, Ingram has averaged 4.73 YPC, including 2.10 after contact, the past six seasons. Those marks rank first and second, respectively, among 31 backs with 650 carries in that span. Ingram ranks second in the league in rushing touchdowns (39), second in rushing OTD (37.5) and tied for first in carries inside the opponent's 5-yard line (61) the past five seasons. The 29-year-old Ingram is a strong bet to pace the extremely run-heavy Ravens' backfield in carries and possibly targets. Ingram has a real shot to eclipse his previous career-high carry total of 230 (2017). He's a flex option who can be upgraded slightly in non-PPR.",

In 2018, Jeffery missed three games and was targeted closer to the line of scrimmage more often, which allowed a healthy 71 percent catch rate and 65/840/6 line. Jeffery was fantasy's No. 17 WR after returning in Week 4. The rangy receiver has reached double digits in end zone targets during each of the past six seasons and is the top perimeter option in a strong Eagles' offense. The 29-year-old is a solid WR2.",

Godwin has three drops on 150 career targets and has ranked top 5 in first down rate each of his two NFL seasons. New coach Bruce Arians, whose wide receivers ranked fifth in fantasy points during his five seasons as Arizona's head coach, says he believes Godwin could push for 100 catches in 2019. That might be a stretch, but Godwin is well positioned for a run at a top 20 fantasy season.",

Lockett had posted between 64 and 69 targets during each of his first three NFL seasons but never cleared 51 receptions, 664 yards or six touchdowns. Lockett, who hasn't dropped a pass since 2016, caught 84 percent of his targets (second best), posted a 14.2 YPT (best) and scored on 14.7 percent of his targets (second best). Lockett was fantasy's No. 16 receiver (his first career top 40) despite managing only one weekly finish better than 14th. Needless to say, Lockett's efficiency isn't close to sustainable and that includes touchdowns (he scored 10 times despite a 3.0 OTD and seven end zone targets). Lockett is a very good player but he needs more volume to be more than a WR3/flex option. He figures to get it following Doug Baldwin's retirement.",

Touchdowns were the difference-maker for the 2017 first-round pick, as he scored 10 times on 66 targets. That 15.2 percent hit rate was tops at the position and is far from sustainable. Williams racked up 12 end zone targets (13th most), but his 6.2 OTD suggests he was over his head. The good news is that Williams' efficiency was otherwise good. He caught 65 percent of his targets despite a 14.6 aDOT (10th highest) and ranked 11th in both YPR (15.4) and YPT (10.1). Williams caught a first down on a position-best 44 percent of his targets. Tyrell Williams' departure sets up Williams with a larger role in his second season. He's an obvious breakout candidate and WR3 option.",

He ended up 31st at the position in receiving yards (788) despite ranking 53rd in pass routes (406) thanks to a league-best average of 7.7 yards after catch. He was limited to two touchdowns (2.2 OTD), but offset that a bit with 172 rushing yards. The versatile 22-year-old is now Carolina's clear No. 1 wide receiver and well positioned for a second-year breakout. He's a WR3 with upside.",
