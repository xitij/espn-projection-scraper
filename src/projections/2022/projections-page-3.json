        "seasonOutlook": "Statistically speaking, Claypool's first two NFL seasons were almost identical in every category with one major exception: touchdowns. He found the end zone on nine of 107 targets (8.4% TD rate) as a rookie, but scored on just two of 104 targets (1.9%) in 2021. The 2020 second-round pick's reception total, yardage, catch rate, off-target rate, yards per reception, yards per target and even his end zone targets (seven in 2020, eight in 2021) were about the same both seasons, but the scoring dip dropped him from 23rd to 37th in fantasy points at WR. Ben Roethlisberger's late-career falloff was an obvious culprit and, though the Steelers' QB situation remains shaky, Claypool is still on the rise at age 23 and has great size at 6-foot-4, 238 pounds. Especially with JuJu Smith-Schuster gone, Claypool is, at worst, a flex.",

He is a thin, vertical receiver with good speed (4.39 40-yard dash) but underwhelming strength/bulk. The OSU product can play inside and out (28% slot in 2021) and does most of his damage down field (14.1 aDOT). He doesn't do much after the catch (weak 4.2 RAC in 2021, 3.8 for career) and will need to clean up late-career drops (seven in 2021). His combination of polish, speed, route-running and ball skills supplies him with big upside and, even with Michael Thomas and Jarvis Landry in the fold, he has a path to a solid target share in 2022. Olave is a fine flex option and he could quickly emerge as Jameis Winston's top target if the oft-injured Thomas misses more time.",

Lance is young (22) and extremely inexperienced (one full season as a college starter), but his combination of size, arm talent and elite rushing ability supplies him with major fantasy upside. Lance has some obvious risk, but he has a good supporting cast and is a major breakout candidate well worth mid-round consideration.",

        "seasonOutlook": "After barely seeing the field during his rookie season, Dillon replaced Jamaal Williams as Aaron Jones' backfield running mate in 2021. Dillon ended up 20th among backs in carries and was more productive than expected as a receiver, posting the second-best catch rate (92%) and YPT (8.5) at the position. The lukewarm usage allowed the occasional big game (four top-15 fantasy outings), but Jones' presence generally kept him off the fantasy radar (10 weekly finishes of 30th or worse). Dillon has thus far been effective and his combination of a huge frame (6-foot, 247 pounds), receiving chops and the Packers' high-scoring offense is appealing. However, his path to consistent fantasy production would involve Jones missing time. In the meantime, Dillon is an elite insurance stash.",

        "seasonOutlook": "Penny re-signed with Seattle and is expected to operate as the team's lead back after a dominant finish to the 2021 season. He was fantasy's top-scoring RB by 11 points after Week 13 and he finished four of the final five weeks as a top-10 fantasy back. Penny's career had previously been marred by injuries, as he has appeared in 37 of 65 possible games in his career (57%). Of course, he's been extremely productive when healthy, as his career 5.6 YPC is second best among backs (minimum 150 carries) since he was selected in the first round of the 2018 draft. Penny is not a factor in the passing game (31 career targets) and rookie Kenneth Walker III will be involved as well, so especially considering Seattle's likely offensive struggles, it's safest to view him as a flex/bench option.",

        "seasonOutlook": "Robinson has been a fantasy force during his first two NFL seasons, but the 2020 UDFA now has more roadblocks than ever before to consistent production. Robinson tore his Achilles late in the 2021 season, which puts his early 2022 availability (and effectiveness) in doubt. Even if ready to play, Robinson will, at best, be sharing the backfield with 2021 first-round pick Travis Etienne Jr. Once healthy, the 220-pound Robinson figures to contribute primarily as a rusher (he owns a career 4.55 YPC), with Etienne the bigger factor in the passing game. Robinson is likely to cap out as a low-ceiling flex option in 2022, but his recovery will need to be monitored throughout the summer.",

Cook isn't quite as big or strong as his older brother, Dalvin, but he has the speed (4.42 40-yard dash), explosiveness and receiving ability to make noise in the pros as a situational back. He totaled 230 carries during four seasons at Georgia (career-high 113 as a senior), but his efficiency was terrific, as he averaged 6.5 yards per carry and 9.4 yards per target while not dropping a single one of his 78 career targets. Cook may never come close to the volume his brother enjoys, but he's joining an elite Buffalo offense and has big upside as a receiving specialist. Expect him to step into No. 2/passing-down duties behind Devin Singletary early on. Consistent fantasy value is unlikely, but he'll be an interesting insurance option and is well worth a late-round pick.",

He was extremely efficient, ranking third in this class in both YAC and FMT rate. Walker has a ways to go in the passing game (a 5% target share led to a 13-89-1 receiving line last season), but he's young (21) and sports a terrific speed/power combo (4.38 40-yard dash). Walker will open his career behind Rashaad Penny, but the latter's major durability concerns positions the rookie as an intriguing insurance stash. If Penny misses time, Walker would leap to the RB2 mix.",

The 2021 second-round pick achieved the feat despite working behind Eric Ebron for a month-and-a-half early on and missing a game-and-a-half due to injury. Freiermuth averaged only 8.2 yards per reception (fourth lowest), but caught 76% of his targets (ninth best) and scored six touchdowns (sixth most). The Steelers' QB situation remains dicey, but Freiermuth was seventh in fantasy points per snap as a rookie and is an obvious candidate for more work and another leap forward in his second season. The 23-year-old is a fringe top-10 fantasy TE.",

He also saw six end zone targets (14th most), but somehow failed to score a single touchdown. As a result, Kmet ended up 20th in fantasy points, but bad luck was obviously a major culprit. The 2020 second-round pick is obviously a full-time player and he's in an even better spot this season as QB Justin Fields enters his second season. Kmet is a breakout candidate in his age-23 campaign and a fine TE2 target.",

He's proven to be a reliable, short-range target, but historic struggles in the TD department have severely limited his fantasy output. Every WR in league history with at least 104 receptions has more than two TD catches � except Meyers, who has two on 168 receptions. Bad luck is part of the issue, but so is a lack of goal-line work (10 career end zone targets). Meyers' targets figure to dip this season with DeVante Parker (among others) added to the mix, so the 25-year-old is best viewed as a low-ceiling PPR flex.",

The 2018 sixth-round pick had emerged as one of Matt Ryan's go-to targets over the last two seasons, though most of the slot man's work has come in the short range (career 8.5 aDOT) and very little has been near the goal line (nine TDs, 19 end zone targets in his career). Tampa Bay's high-volume, pass-heavy offense has supported three fantasy-relevant wide receivers at times over the last two seasons, though Gage has plenty of competition for work via Mike Evans, Chris Godwin and Julio Jones. Godwin could miss some early action as he recovers from a torn ACL, which could mean early-season WR3 production for Gage, but his ceiling appears limited when all four receivers are healthy.",

It's a decent chunk for a player that has never finished a season higher than 50th in targets, receptions, yards or fantasy points among WRs despite playing with Aaron Rodgers. The 2018 fifth-round pick has taken \"boom/bust vertical target\" to the extreme, ranking first in average depth of target (15.8) and yards per reception (17.5), but last in catch rate (50.2%) and off-target rate (32%) since entering the league. The 27-year-old remains in an elite offense and has a path to an every-down role, but his lack of emergence in Green Bay is a red flag. He's worth only a late-round flier.",

Moore is on the small side, but he has the biggest hands in this class and showed well athletically at the combine. Moore has a shot at a sizable rookie-season role if he can overtake the likes of JuJu Smith-Schuster, Mecole Hardman and/or Marquez Valdes-Scantling for work. One of Patrick Mahomes' top targets if he progresses well, Moore needs to be on your mid-round radar.",

He finished 37th in fantasy PPG, his worst showing since 2017. Boyd is only 27 and a tremendously important and reliable player (zero drops last season), but he'll be a WR3/flex option only if Chase or Higgins misses time.",

He handled a hefty 32% target share and led this year's rookie class in yards per route run in 2021. He aligned in the slot 77% of the time during his three seasons, primarily working as a deep threat in his first year before shining as a short-range, RAC weapon the last two seasons. Burks ran a solid 4.55 40-yard dash at 225 pounds (heaviest in the class) at the combine. With A.J. Brown gone and Robert Woods recovering from a torn ACL, Burks very well could lead Tennessee in targets as a rookie. The Titans' run-heavy offense will limit his ceiling a bit, but Burks is a fine flex target.",

He soaked up a hefty 31% target share in 2021 (after a 30% share in 2020), posting a 91-1182-12 receiving line while hauling in 91% of his catchable targets (second in this rookie class) and dropping only two balls. Terry McLaurin is Washington's top wide receiver and Curtis Samuel is back from injury, so while Dotson has a path to a starting role, he certainly has some competition for targets. Perhaps he'll leap into the WR3/flex mix as a rookie, but he's best viewed as a mid-round bench option.",

        "seasonOutlook": "Carter is entering his second season with the Jets, though his fantasy value took a major hit when the team drafted Breece Hall in April. Carter -- a 2021 fourth-round pick -- shared backfield duties during most of his first season, but he showed his upside when called upon for a larger workload around midseason. Carter hit a high in Week 8 against the Bengals, pacing all backs in fantasy points thanks to 172 yards and a score on 24 touches. His playing time dwindled from there, however, and he missed three games due to injury. Carter impressed as a rookie and has upside as a receiver, but he's a bit undersized and is now likely to be limited to situational carries and a passing-down role behind Hall. Carter has some insurance appeal, but he figures to struggle for consistent flex production.",

The veteran back is one of 11 players in NFL history with at least nine TDs in six straight seasons and one of 11 players in NFL history with zero TDs on 200-plus touches in a single season. How's that for an incredible stat? Gordon has found the end zone 67 times over the last six seasons after going scoreless as a rookie in 2015. He split backfield duties with Javonte Williams in Denver last season and posted a career-best 2.2 YAC, which was in the 80th percentile among backs. Despite the impressive season, Gordon hasn't had a top-12 fantasy campaign since 2018 and is now 29 years old. He's a strong bet to defer more work to Williams and figures to cap out as a pedestrian flex option, though he does have elite insurance value.",

Hines has flirted with occasional fantasy value (27th in 2018 and 15th in 2020), but the emergence of Jonathan Taylor crushed his value in 2021. Despite appearing in all 17 games, Hines posted career-low marks in routes, targets, receptions and receiving yards. His 5-foot-8 frame won't allow much usage as a rusher (career-high 89 carries) and, while the QB change to Matt Ryan could mean more targets, Indianapolis already targeted RBs at an above-average rate last season, so we can't count on much of a boost. The 25-year-old is best left on benches as long as Taylor is active.",

Robinson is a huge power back, who ranked at or near the top of this year's rookie class in weight (225 pounds), hand size and wingspan. He was used sparingly during his first three seasons at Alabama, but emerged as lead back in 2021, posting a 271-1,343-14 rushing line in 14 games, adding 35-296-2 as a receiver. Robinson has sufficient speed for his size and his collegiate elusiveness and tackle breaking numbers were both strong. Robinson is not going to play much in the short term with Antonio Gibson and J.D. McKissic locked in atop the depth chart, though he has some insurance appeal, as he'd leap into the flex discussion if Gibson were to miss time.",

Carr has never cleared 140 rush yards in a single season and has six rushing TDs in eight campaigns. That will continue to limit Carr's fantasy output, but the good news is that he enters 2022 with the best supporting cast of his career after Las Vegas acquired Davante Adams as a running mate for Darren Waller, Hunter Renfrow and Josh Jacobs. Carr should be considered a strong QB2 with back-end QB1 upside.",

        "seasonOutlook": "Cousins has proven to be the ultimate QB2 in recent years, having failed to post a top-10 fantasy campaign since 2017, but having also delivered six top-12 campaigns over the last seven seasons. Cousins does his damage with his arm, having finished no lower than ninth in passing TDs each of the last five seasons. He's also been top 10 in passing yards six of the last seven seasons. The Minnesota offense will look different with new coach Kevin O'Connell calling the shots, but that may actually lead to more passing volume for Cousins. The 34-year-old doesn't offer much with his legs (career high of 179 rush yards), but he's been playing at a high level for years and has Justin Jefferson, Adam Thielen and Dalvin Cook in his arsenal. Cousins is a strong QB2.",

Including the playoffs, the 2019 third-round pick was on the field for 87% of snaps during 17 active weeks. During the regular season, Knox led all tight ends in touchdowns (nine) and TD rate (12.3%), while finishing fourth in end zone targets (nine). On the negative side, Knox was targeted only 73 times (20th at the position) and fell short of a top-10 fantasy campaign. The 25-year-old's usage doesn't figure to rise in 2022 with O.J. Howard now in the fold, so even in an elite Buffalo offense, he's best viewed as a good TE2.",

Henry ended up 10th in fantasy points, marking his third consecutive top-12 fantasy campaign. He did see a late-season boost in targets and, coupled with his heavy goal-line usage and Mac Jones' strong play, the 27-year-old tight end is very much in the TE1 discussion.",

Gesicki is fresh off a 2021 season in which he posted career-high marks in targets, receptions and yardage en route to his second consecutive top-eight fantasy campaign. Gesicki's fantasy production would've looked even better if not for a huge dip in goal line work. The 2018 second-round pick racked up 11 TDs and 22 end zone targets during the 2019-20 seasons, but plummeted to four end zone targets (24th at TE) and two TDs (34th) in 2021. The 26-year-old has more competition for targets this season with Tyreek Hill in the mix, but a dip in targets can be offset by more scoring opportunities in what should be a better offense. Gesicki is a fringe top-10 fantasy TE.",

Lawrence was plenty busy in his first season, as the 2021 first-overall pick ranked seventh in pass attempts and fifth in carries among QBs. However, he ranked first in INTs and dealt with a league-high 39 drops, ending up with just 12 passing TDs and some extremely ugly efficiency numbers (33.5 QBR, 6.0 YPA, 60% completion rate). Of course, the struggles are not uncommon for a rookie, and his play improved in the final month of the season. Lawrence's supporting cast will be much better in 2022 with new coach Doug Pederson, as well as Christian Kirk, Travis Etienne Jr., Evan Engram and Brandon Scherff. Lawrence is a breakout candidate worth a look in the later rounds.",

He's thus far been very conservative (his 7.0 average depth of throw ranked near the basement of the league last season) and hasn't added much with his legs, but perhaps both will change with Mike McDaniel running the offense. Tagovailoa's youth and improved situation makes him well worth a late flier.",

        "seasonOutlook": "Fields enters his second NFL season as the clear starter in Chicago. The 2021 first-round pick was about as bad as you can get from a fantasy perspective out of the gate in his career, finishing with single digits in six of his first seven appearances. The light seemed to go on after that, as he finished as a top-12 fantasy QB in each of his final four full games. Despite appearing in only 12 games, Fields ranked fifth among QBs in rushing yards for the season. He obviously as a lot of fantasy appeal due to his rushing, but he was also aggressive as a passer, leading the league with a 9.8 average depth of throw. The dual-threat QB's supporting cast is very weak, but his legs make him a breakout candidate worth considering in the late rounds.",

He saw more low-percentage/deep balls in 2020 and, combined with weak QB play (27% off target rate was third highest at WR) and three missed games, he fell outside the top 40 receivers. His 2021 season ended with a broken ankle in Week 4. Chark is a big, fast perimeter target, but his ceiling will be limited with Amon-Ra St. Brown, D'Andre Swift, T.J. Hockenson and inevitably rookie Jameson Williams ahead of him for targets. Chark belongs on benches, though Williams' ACL recovery could allow the 25-year-old some early-season flex value.",

The veteran slot man peaked with five consecutive top-20 fantasy campaigns during 2015-19, but his usage and durability have dipped the past two seasons and he's finished worse than 30th each of the past two seasons. Landry has always been limited a bit by a short-range, slot role (career 7.7 aDOT) and minimal goal-line work (5.3 TDs and 5.4 end zone targets per season), but he's overcome that with massive target shares. He's still been at or above a 24% share in seven straight seasons, which is impressive, but the missed time and career-low TD output (five TDs the last two seasons) have led to the recent slump. Landry is now 29 years old and has more competition than usual for targets with Michael Thomas and Chris Olave in the mix. Landry figures to max out as a PPR flex in deeper leagues.",

The 2021 third-round pick will again be competing with the same three receivers he worked behind last season, and while he won't pass Keenan Allen and Mike Williams on the depth chart, Jalen Guyton's No. 3 role is attainable. That's especially the case after Palmer flashed on the rare occasions he played a big role. He was on the field for more than 60% of pass plays in three games and posted 5-66-1, 5-43-1 and 4-45-1 receiving lines during those outings. Palmer is only 22 years old and, while standalone value will be tough early on, he's one injury away from a major role in the Chargers' high-scoring, Justin Herbert-led offense. Consider drafting him late.",

Anderson ranked sixth in both snaps and routes, but was 28th in targets, 44th in receptions and 64th in yards. His 48% catch rate, 4.7 yards per target and 0.9 yards per route run were all 87th or worse among 91 qualified wide receivers. Anderson has 18th- and 19th-place fantasy seasons on his resume, but has been 39th or worse three of the past four seasons. It's hard to get too excited here, but perhaps the arrival of Baker Mayfield will help Anderson to a bounceback. His top-20 fantasy showing in Matt Rhule's offense in 2020 also adds some hope, but he's too risky to consider before the later rounds.",

Jones handled a solid 21% target share during both campaigns and, despite the Jaguars' offensive struggles, has reeled off three consecutive top-35 fantasy seasons. His TDs took a dive last season (four, his lowest since 2016), but it was extremely unlucky (he tied for second in the NFL with 15 end zone targets). Jones' age is a concern, as is added target competition led by Christian Kirk, but an every-down role coupled with a Trevor Lawrence second-year leap would keep Jones in the fantasy discussion. He's a fine bench option.",

He hasn't quite lived up to expectations since being selected in the first round back in 2015, having managed to finish just one season better than 40th in fantasy points (11th in 2019). Durability has been the main issue, as he appeared in 100% of Miami's regular-season games in only one of his seven campaigns there. That includes seven missed games in 2021. Parker was a top-35 fantasy WR during 10 active weeks last season and could emerge as Mac Jones' top perimeter/vertical target, but his age (29) and durability woes are obvious concerns. He's fine for your bench, but expect inconsistent production.",

Instead, he was limited to five games in 2020 due to injury before missing three more games and struggling badly to produce in the Giants' horrific offense in 2021. Golladay went from ranking first at the position in touchdowns and third in end zone targets (15) in 2019 to failing to score a single TD in 2021. Golladay is now 28 years old and has struggled with durability for two seasons, but it's hard to throw in the towel on a 6-foot-4 vertical target who has had his level of success. There's at least hope for a rebound with Brian Daboll in town, so Golladay is a worthwhile late-round dart throw.",

        "seasonOutlook": "Fant was traded to Seattle after spending his first three NFL seasons in Denver. The 2019 first-round pick has been a busy man the last two years, finishing top 10 among tight ends in targets, receptions and yards. Fant's efficiency has been above average despite Denver's QB woes, though his Achilles' heel has been goal-line work and, in turn, touchdowns. Fant has 16 career end zone targets and has yet to clear four TDs in a single season. He is young (24), extremely talented and will be a top-three target in Seattle, but producing a third straight top-12 fantasy campaign may be tough with the Seahawks expected to start QB Drew Lock. Fant is a fringe TE1 with limited short-term upside.",

Smith has thus far been limited to 91 targets in 29 regular-season games (3.1 per game) and has yet to deliver a top-20 fantasy campaign. With Kyle Rudolph sidelined during the final four weeks of 2020, Smith posted a strong 15-183-3 receiving line and was TE4 in fantasy, though he was out-targeted 22-to-20 by Tyler Conklin. Of course, Rudolph and Conklin are gone, which positions Smith for a big boost in usage in 2022. The 2019 second-round pick is still very young (entering his age-23 season) and makes for a solid TE2 with room for more.",

The two moves -- along with the acquisition of QB Deshaun Watson (once back from suspension) -- have Njoku in the best position for fantasy success since he finished ninth in 2018. Injuries (15 missed) and Hooper's presence derailed Njoku's production during the 2019-20 seasons, but he bounced back a bit in 2021 thanks to great efficiency -- top five in RAC (6.8) and YPT (9.0) -- and a boost in goal line work (his seven end zone targets ranked 11th). The 2017 first-round pick is still only 26 years old and will be a featured target this season. He's safest as a back-end TE2, but a big leap is possible.",

        "seasonOutlook": "Higbee enters his sixth NFL season fresh off another ho-hum campaignin which he finished 13th among tight ends in fantasy points -- his third-consecutive finish in the 10-to-20 range. Higbee missed two games (he's missed at least one each of the last three seasons), but still finished no lower than ninth in snaps, routes or receptions. He made his hay near the goal line with a career-high nine end zone targets (fourth most) and five TDs (ninth). Higbee was used more near the line of scrimmage (career-low 5.2 aDOT), which limited his yardage output. The 29-year-old is a better real-life player than fantasy asset and best viewed as a back-end TE2.",

Of the defense's top 11 players in snaps last season, only two (Levi Wallace, Jerry Hughes) departed, and the unit is actually better on paper after Von Miller, DaQuan Jones and first-round pick Kaiir Elam were added to a group that includes stars Tre'Davious White, Jordan Poyer and Micah Hyde, as well as recent first-round picks Ed Oliver and Gregory Rousseau.

Green Bay has finished around mid-pack in most categories during the stretch, but did finish sixth with 18 INTs in 2021. Turnovers are tough to predict, but a loaded secondary led by Jaire Alexander and Adrian Amos suggests many more are in their future. Eleven of the team's top 12 defenders in 2021 snaps are back and it's hard to find a weakness with Kenny Clark up front, Preston Smith and Rashan Gary on the edge, De'Vondre Campbell re-signed at linebacker and the aforementioned strong secondary. This is a starting-caliber fantasy unit.",

Baltimore finished 27th in fantasy points after five consecutive seasons as a top-seven unit. Prior to 2021, Baltimore had finished no worse than 12th in yards allowed in an incredible eight consecutive seasons. Now healthy, the Ravens once again have a top secondary, which is led by Marlon Humphrey, Marcus Peters (who missed all of 2021), Chuck Clark, prize free-agent addition Marcus Williams and first-round rookie Kyle Hamilton. Add that group to the likes of Calais Campbell, Michael Pierce and 2021 first-round pick Odafe Oweh and suddenly this has the look of a top-10 overall unit on paper. Baltimore is well positioned for a major rebound and is a viable starting option in fantasy.",

The 49ers have ranked no worse than fifth in yards allowed each of the last three seasons and they ranked first in forced fumbles, fifth in sacks and top 10 in points allowed in both 2019 and 2021. Interceptions have been an issue (nine in 2021), but this is a very good defense on paper, led by stars Nick Bosa, Fred Warner, Jimmie Ward and Arik Armstead.  Several regulars departed during the offseason, but they were replaced by players returning from injury, as well as free-agent signings Kerry Hyder, Kemoko Turay and -- most importantly -- new top corner Charvarius Ward. This is a fine starting option in fantasy.",

The success was driven primarily by an enormous 26 INTs, which is the third most by a defense over the last decade, as well as 10 TDs, which was more than the nine the unit totaled the prior six seasons. Those two categories will regress and Dallas was otherwise around league average in most key categories, so a step back for this unit is likely. On the plus side, Dallas returns nearly its entire core and the biggest loss (Randy Gregory) was replaced by Dante Fowler Jr. and rookie Sam Williams. This defense has a few holes, but enough stars in DeMarcus Lawrence (who missed most of 2021), Micah Parsons and Trevon Diggs to generate another good fantasy campaign.",

The success has been powered by forced turnovers, as Indy was top 10 in INTs and turnovers all four years. The Colts struggled to generate pressure and sacks last season, but adding Yannick Ngakoue to the edge room along with 2021 first-round pick Kwity Paye is a step in the right direction. The Colts also have a star up front (DeForest Buckner) and at linebacker (Darius Leonard), as well as a good secondary led by corners Kenny Moore and Stephon Gilmore. The Colts are positioned for a third straight top-10 fantasy campaign.",

The fall was a bit of a shock after Pittsburgh finished second in both 2019 and 2020 and it came despite the defense leading the NFL in sacks for the fifth consecutive season. The big dip was related to a major drop in terms of yardage allowed (24th), points allowed (21st) and INTs (15th), which were all categories the Steelers finished top five in the prior two seasons. Most of the team's core (led by stars T.J. Watt, Cameron Heyward and Minkah Fitzpatrick) is back, and the unit will also have a healthy Stephon Tuitt (out all of 2021), as well as newcomers Myles Jack and Levi Wallace. This is a fringe top-10 fantasy unit.",

Injuries were a culprit, as star edge rushers Chase Young and Montez Sweat both missed nearly half the season. In turn, Washington was average or worse in nearly every category, which included a fall from sixth to 17th in sacks and fifth to 22nd in INTs. The good news is that Washington's defense looks pretty good on paper, especially with 14 of the top 16 in 2021 snaps still on the roster. A healthy Young and Sweat join Jonathan Allen and Daron Payne to form one of the league's best defensive lines, and Kendall Fuller, William Jackson and Kamren Curl lead a solid secondary.
