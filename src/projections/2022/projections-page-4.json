Believe it or not, he's never finished a season in the top spot, though his third-place finish in 2021 marks his fifth top five in in the last six seasons. He was, as usual, the league's best kicker, nailing 35-of-37 attempts (league-high 94.6%) despite an average distance of 40.5 (sixth highest). He also made all 32 of his extra points. Tucker has shown no signs of slowing down as he enters his age-32 season and remains locked in as an elite fantasy kicker.",

Including the playoffs, McPherson connected on 42-of-47 field goal attempts. That 89.4% hit rate is pretty good, but even better when you consider that the average distance of his attempts (40.7) was fourth highest in the league (his 41.8 average during the regular season led the league). McPherson also nailed 52-of-54 extra points (96.3%) and finished the regular season seventh in fantasy points. Cincinnati's offense only figures to be better this season following big upgrades up front, so McPherson has the look of a top fantasy option.",

He was the No. 4 fantasy kicker with Tampa Bay as a rookie before posting the sixth-most points during a seven-game stint with the Rams in 2020. Gay followed with a fifth-place fantasy campaign in 2021. The 2019 fifth-round pick struggled with accuracy as a rookie, but not so much since that point. Last season, Gay nailed 32-of-34 field goals during the regular season and his 94.1% conversion rate trailed only Justin Tucker for best in the league. He has missed just one of 65 extra-point attempts over the last two seasons. Kicking for one of the league's top teams, the 28-year-old is positioned for another strong fantasy campaign.",

        "seasonOutlook": "After beginning his career with three consecutive top-seven fantasy campaigns, Butker has finished just outside the top 10 each of the last two seasons. That includes a career-worst 12th in 2021. A change in opportunity has been the issue, as the Chiefs ranked third in field goal attempts during the 2017-19 seasons, but 22nd the last two seasons. Butker's 2021 FG conversion rate of 89.3% was the second-lowest of his career, but when you factor in his career average distance (41.1), it was actually his most-accurate season. Despite the dip in field goal tries, the 27-year-old remains a terrific fantasy kicker due to his elite accuracy and Kansas City's high-scoring offense.",

In fact, if we include his third-place finish in 2020, Carlson has scored 22 more fantasy points than any other kicker over the last two seasons. The 2018 fifth-round pick's success has stemmed from a combination of heavy volume and great accuracy. Carlson has converted 73-of-78 field goals over the last two seasons. That 93.6% hit rate trails only Younghoe Koo for tops in the league during the span. He attempted three more FGs than any other kicker in 2021 after finishing sixth in attempts in 2020. Las Vegas' offense only figures to be better this season with Davante Adams on the roster, so Carlson remains a strong fantasy option in his age-27 campaign.",

Folk, who is now 37 years old, has nailed 62-of-67 field goals during the span. That 92.5% conversion rate is third best in the league during the span, though he has struggled with extra points (90.0%). Last season, New England attempted 39 field goals (third most), which along with his terrific FG accuracy, allowed Folk a second-place fantasy finish -- his first top 10 in over a decade. Folk is a good bet for a step back this season, but he's still a fine starting option in fantasy.",

Bass' accuracy has been ordinary, but he's benefited from tremendous opportunity in Buffalo's high-powered offense. He's finished second in extra-point attempts each of the last two seasons and is seventh in FG attempts during the span. Bass' 84.8% FG conversion rate is just under league average, though he's been terrific on extra points (98.2%). The 2020 sixth-round pick is a solid, young kicker in one of the league's best offenses. He's a starting option in fantasy.",

Prater has generally been around average in short-to-intermediate kicks in his career, but he's elite from long distance. Over the last decade, he ranks first in attempts (73), conversions (54) and hit rate (74.0%) from 50-plus yards. The 38-year-old returns to Arizona's high-scoring offense in 2022 and is positioned for another good fantasy campaign.",

Gano converted all but two of the 40 extra points and also ranks sixth in made field goals (60) since the start of 2020, which has powered him to the 14th-most fantasy points during the span. New York's offense figures to be better under Brian Daboll, so coupled with terrific accuracy, 35-year-old Gano is a fringe starting option in fantasy.",

The 28-year-old has been busy in the role over the last two seasons, ranking no lower than second among backs in targets, receptions and receiving yards in 2020 and no lower than sixth in the three categories prior to a suffering a season-ending injury last season. McKissic is severely limited as a rusher (he's never cleared 85 carries in a season and has four career rushing TDs) and his ceiling is limited by the presence of early-down and goal-line back Antonio Gibson. Of course, even with Gibson around, McKissic was 17th in fantasy points in 2020 and 22nd prior to the injury last season. McKissic's role will allow him to occasionally flirt with PPR flex value.",

Believe it or not, Mostert's career 5.7 YPC is tops in NFL history among all backs with 200-plus carries. Of course, he only has 284 career attempts due primarily to horrific injury luck. Mostert has played more than 11 games in a season once in his career (2019) and missed all but four snaps last season due to an injury. He could handle upward of half the carries and the occasional target (he's never cleared 22 in a single season), with Chase Edmonds, Sony Michel and perhaps Myles Gaskin also involved in the offense. Mostert is likely to max out as a flex option and is a poor bet to hold up for the entire season.",

Cook was sidelined for four games in 2021 and Mattison produced 518 yards and three TDs on 105 touches in his stead. He paced all backs in fantasy points during the span. Mattison is extremely young for a fourth-year vet (24), but he'll remain no more than an elite insurance option as long as Cook is in the picture.",

        "seasonOutlook": "Henderson is entering his fourth season with the Rams. The 2019 third-round pick has seen his role progressively increase throughout his career, but his heavy 2021 usage was related directly to Cam Akers' preseason torn Achilles. During the first half of the season, Henderson was playing three-quarters of the snaps and providing RB2 fantasy production. Injuries cost him all but a few snaps in the second half of the season and he ended up working behind a healed Akers in the Super Bowl. By all accounts, Akers will be the main man in the Los Angeles backfield moving forward, leaving Henderson to situational work. The 25-year-old has some insurance appeal, but likely won't be a weekly flex option.",

The two were active together for 10 games and though they were about even in carries those weeks, Swift played 197 more snaps (413 to 216) and saw 42 more targets (64 to 22). Whereas Swift was fourth among RBs in fantasy points those weeks, Williams was 30th. Williams has generally averaged 10-to-11 touches per game throughout his career and that's what we should expect in 2022. Barring a major Swift injury, the 27-year-old is a long shot for his first career top-30 fantasy campaign.",

Gainwell played more than 40% of the snaps in only three games and was limited to five weekly fantasy finishes better than 38th. He totaled 544 yards on 101 touches and was a bit lucky in the TD department (six TDs, 3.5 expected). Gainwell will battle for a larger share of the pie this season, but Miles Sanders and Boston Scott will both be involved as well. The Eagles' run-heavy scheme makes Gainwell a fine bench hold, though his 191-pound frame is likely to limit him to situational duties throughout his career.",

The 24-year-old spent most of the season picking up the scraps behind feature back David Montgomery, though he saw extended action during the four weeks Montgomery was out with an injury. Herbert reached 18 carries and 70 rushing yards in all four games, but a lack of scoring (one TD) and receiving work (10 targets) limited him to the 18th-most fantasy points among RBs during the span. Herbert appears to be a solid backfield option, so there's some insurance appeal here, but he won't have standalone value as long as Montgomery is healthy.",

Allgeier isn't the fastest (4.60 40-yard dash) and he's a work in progress as a receiver, but he's 224 pounds and has a path to a big rookie-season role on a depth chart led by over-age-30 backs Cordarrelle Patterson and Damien Williams. Allgeier is a sleeper to lead Atlanta in carries in 2022 and is well worth a late pick in season-long formats.",

Pacheco is a big, fast back who posted the best speed score in this class at the combine (4.37 40-yard dash at 216 pounds). He was a factor in the Rutgers backfield during all four seasons at the school, ending up with a 563-2442-18 rushing line and 47-249-1 receiving line. Pacheco's collegiate efficiency was about as poor as it gets (4.3 YPC and 3.7 YPT are both worst in this class), though he had little help (his 1.6 yards before contact is easily lowest in the class). Pacheco was also weak in the YAC and FMT categories, but added some value as a returner and pass blocker. He'll battle for a roster spot behind Clyde Edwards-Helaire and Ronald Jones.",

The yardage total was highest in this year's rookie class. Massively utilized, Tolbert handled a target share of at least 33% and an air-yard share of at least 53% in both 2020 and 2021. He's 6-foot-1 with 10-inch hands, decent wheels and the ability to play inside or out, but is a bit older than most rookies, faced light competition and will need to clean up the drops (eight in 2021). Tolbert's chief competition for No. 3 duties in a good Dallas offense is James Washington (who will miss some time), so there's potential Year 1 fantasy value here (especially if Michael Gallup's ACL recovery costs him game time). Keep him on your radar in the late rounds.",

Pickens is a 6-foot-3, vertical receiver who almost exclusively plays outside (his 13% career slot rate is third lowest in this rookie class). We barely saw him in 2021, as he tore his ACL in the spring and appeared in only four games. Most of his damage has come down field (career 14.2 aDOT) and he's shown good hands (two drops on 142 career targets) and ball skills. Pickens has some discipline issues, but he's only 21 years old and can develop as the No. 3 behind Diontae Johnson and Chase Claypool. With the Steelers' quarterback situation a work in progress, Pickens is a longshot for consistent early-career fantasy production, but he has major long-term upside. Consider him with a late-round pick.",

The second-round pick was almost exclusively limited to short-range/gadget plays, as 51% of his 65 targets were screens, 25% of his touches were carries and his 1.3 average depth of target was lowest among 91 qualified wide receivers. Moore's lack of vertical targets and goal-line work (one end zone target) severely limited his fantasy output (three top-40 outings). Moore is only 22 years old and his best days are likely ahead of him, but he may not have a path to a substantially larger role this season with DeAndre Hopkins, Marquise Brown, A.J. Green and Zach Ertz in the fold. He's not worth considering until the last few rounds of your draft.",

The lack of emergence doesn't necessarily seem to be his fault, however, as he's yet to miss a single game (an impressive feat) and trails only Deebo Samuel in RAC (8.6) over the last three seasons. Hardman's three seasons of low target shares (he hasn't cleared 13% in a season) are a red flag, but the departure of Tyreek Hill certainly opens up a major opportunity in what is Hardman's first contract year. The 25-year-old is what he's been the last three draft seasons: a fine late-round flier.",

The commitment to Gallup and the trade of Amari Cooper locks the former into a big role once healthy, but it's fair to expect missed time and/or a slow start considering the injury happened in Week 17. Once back on the field, Gallup will be positioned for a generous target share behind CeeDee Lamb in a productive, high-volume offense. At the same time, Gallup has yet to deliver a top-20 fantasy campaign in four tries and his only top-35 season was back in 2019. Gallup's recovery will need to be evaluated throughout the summer, but we can consider him a good flex/bench option in drafts.",

The 2021 third-round pick played a situational role in his first season, clearing five targets in only three games. A 6-foot-4, 222-pound perimeter receiver, Collins was sent deep often (12th-highest average depth of route), but simply wasn't thrown at much, and even when he was, 26% were off target (fifth highest). Collins enters 2022 with a clear path to an every-down role opposite Brandin Cooks. Of course, his prospects will revolve around how well Davis Mills plays in his second season. Collins is a bit of a lottery ticket well worth late-round consideration.",

Jones did flash a bit last season, including a 5-58-1 receiving line on 10 targets in Week 18, but he's now 33 years old and ticketed for a situational role in a Tampa Bay offense that also includes Mike Evans, Chris Godwin and Russell Gage. The high-scoring, pass-heavy Buccaneers' offense is appealing, but Jones figures to be a boom/bust producer. He's only worth a look late in drafts.",

The former second-round pick was primarily utilized as a situational deep threat, posting a 13.3 average depth of target (14th highest among WRs) and averaging 16.0 yards per reception (seventh). Jefferson finished 36th in fantasy points, though that number would've been much worse had Robert Woods not been lost for the season just hours after the Rams traded for Jefferson's replacement (Odell Beckham Jr.). Jefferson has yet to miss a game and has the look of a solid player, but he's behind at least Cooper Kupp and Allen Robinson II for targets, and a major boost in production seems unlikely for the 26-year-old. He's worth a bench spot only.",

Granted, he was oft-targeted near the line of scrimmage (7.4 aDOT), but Samuel's 79% catch rate paced all wide receivers in 2020. His durability is a concern (he's missed 23 games in five seasons) and Terry McLaurin and perhaps first-round pick Jahan Dotson will be ahead of him for targets, but he's entering his age-26 season and certainly could return to the flex discussion. Samuel deserves some late-round consideration.",

In the slot 79% of the time, Robinson soaked up a class-high 40% of the Wildcats' targets, as well as 45% of the air yards. He finished first or second in this rookie class in YPRR (3.5), targets (144), receptions (104) and yards (1,334). Robinson's explosiveness and versatility (he can contribute as a rusher and returner) should lead to, at least, a gadget role in New York this season. Of course, he's a longshot for short-term fantasy value in a WR room with decent depth and will be worth no more than a late flier in 2022 drafts.",

The North Dakota State product was one of the biggest winners at the combine, measuring in at 6-foot-4 with 10 1/8-inch hands while showing well in every athletic drill. The latter included a 4.36 40-yard dash and class-best 136-inch broad jump. Watson was utilized in a variety of ways during four seasons at NDSU. He was a vertical threat (career 20.5 YPR on 104 catches), ball carrier (49 carries) and kick returner (27 attempts). He played at a \"small\" school, but his outstanding combination of size, speed, athleticism and versatility makes him an intriguing prospect. He has a path to an every-down role in an elite Packers' offense, as his top competition is oft-injured Allen Lazard, Randall Cobb and Sammy Watkins. Watson should be on your radar in the mid-to-late rounds.",

After inexplicably being limited to 15 catches during two seasons at Ohio State, Williams exploded for a 79-1572-15 campaign at Alabama in 2021. Williams' rare combination of height, elite speed and quickness make him a major threat for explosive plays. That was on display last season, as he averaged 19.9 yards per reception, a class-best 13.1 yards per target and 9.5 yards after the catch. Williams tore his ACL in the national title game, but the former hurdler is only 21 years old and won't be rushed by a rebuilding Detroit team. Expect a slow start for Williams (and perhaps a few missed games to open his career), but he has elite upside and figures to be a fixture in fantasy lineups by midseason.",

        "seasonOutlook": "Pierce was selected by the Colts in the second round of April's draft. He is a big receiver who is more vertical/contested catch than he is quickness/separation. He never had an aDOT below 14.7 during four seasons at Cincinnati and he handled at least 24% of the team's air yards when active each of the last three seasons. That includes a 36% share while delivering a 52-884-8 receiving line in 2021. Pierce crushed it at the combine with a class-best 40.5-inch vertical and 4.41 40-yard dash at 211 pounds. Granted, his ceiling will be limited by the Colts' run-heavy offense, but Pierce has a path to every-down snaps as the team's likely No. 2 wide receiver behind Michael Pittman Jr. With Matt Ryan in town, Pierce very well could flirt with occasional flex value. He's worth a look in the late rounds.",

He appeared destined for stardom when he produced a rookie tight end-record 174 fantasy points back in 2017. Instead, he's struggled with injuries and the Giants' weak offense en route to four straight fantasy finishes of 13th or worse. The 2017 first-round pick has settled in as a short/intermediate target and hasn't been used near the goal line (no more than three TDs or three end zone targets in a season since 2017). Engram will benefit from new coach Doug Pederson's very TE-friendly offense (career 31% TE target share in eight seasons), though he'll need to stay healthy and fend off Dan Arnold for work. The 28-year-old is no more than a late-round lottery ticket.",

The 2016 third-round pick's fantasy stock took a dive with the Browns, as he followed up a pair of sixth-place fantasy finishes with Atlanta (2018-19) with a pair of finishes outside the top 20 the last two seasons. There were a variety of reasons for the decline, including a drop in targets, a dip in efficiency and shaky durability (seven missed games over the last three seasons). Hooper's upside will be limited in the Titans' run-heavy scheme, though coach Mike Vrabel's TE units in Tennessee have averaged a hefty 24% target share in his four seasons. Hooper is a low-ceiling, fringe TE2.",

He was then traded to Atlanta and broke out with a 56-571-6 receiving line and 10th-place fantasy finish in 2020. Of course, the Falcons then drafted Kyle Pitts and Hurst was out of a starting job. The 29-year-old is now positioned as the starter in a good Cincinnati offense, which sets the sure-handed (one career drop) tight end as an intriguing post-hype sleeper. Consider him late in deeper drafts.",

        "seasonOutlook": "Jones finally appeared to be on the verge of a breakout last season, opening 2021 with at least 21 fantasy points in three of his first four games. The wheels fell off from there, as he failed to produce another top-12 outing before missing the final six games due to injury. Durability is a real concern, as he's missed at least two games during each of his three NFL seasons. Jones has yet to deliver a top-20 fantasy campaign, but there is a sliver of hope here after New York hired Brian Daboll as head coach. Also, much like Daboll's previous QB, Josh Allen, Jones' legs are an asset; he ranks sixth at the position with 1,000 rushing yards since 2019. Jones is worth a look only as a QB2 toward the end of your draft.",

His fantasy production was extremely inconsistent last season, as he posted a pair of top-five outings, but was 16th or worse during his other four full games prior to tearing his ACL in Week 8. Winston did play pretty well prior to the injury (fifth-best QBR) and he'll have a better group of targets with Michael Thomas, Jarvis Landry and rookie Chris Olave now in the fold. Winston's last full season (2019) resulted in a fifth-place fantasy finish and while he's unlikely to match that same volume, his aggressive nature (top six in average depth of throw in all six seasons) offers some hope for fantasy-relevance. He's best viewed as a late-round flier.",

        "seasonOutlook": "The Chargers' D/ST finished 24th in fantasy points last season, its third straight finish worse than 20th. It was a disappointing effort in defensive-minded coach Brandon Staley's first season, but there were some signs of life, including a third-place finish in forced fumbles and the 11th-best pass rush win rate. The Chargers' 11 INTs placed them 22nd, but the offseason additions of J.C. Jackson (one of three players over the last 20 years with eight-plus INTs in consecutive seasons) and Bryce Callahan helps in a big way. Los Angeles also traded for star Khalil Mack to work opposite Joey Bosa on the edge and upgraded its interior line, which along with star safety Derwin James, sets this unit up for a potential breakout in 2022.",

Despite the lack of recent production, there's reason for optimism that this unit will be fantasy-relevant in 2022. For starters, after years of horrendous production, the unit made a leap in nearly every category last season, including top-15 finishes in INTs and sacks. More importantly, the defense looks good on paper, with 14 of the top 15 players in snaps on the AFC Championship roster set to return. The defense is led by terrific duos at edge (Sam Hubbard, Trey Hendrickson), safety (Jessie Bates and Vonn Bell) and tackle (D.J. Reader, B.J. Hall) and are solid at corner and linebacker. The Bengals' D/ST is a fringe starting option.",

He soaked up 122 carries, which was nearly double his previous career high of 74. Burkhead was serviceable in the role, but had atrocious help (1.43 yards before contact was fourth worst among RBs) and wasn't a big factor as a receiver (32 targets in 16 games). He ended up with one weekly fantasy finish better than 24th. Burkhead is now 32 years old and likely to play a reduced role with Marlon Mack and rookie Dameon Pierce added to the fold. There's minimal fantasy appeal here.",

He is a big back with huge hands who lacks experience; he totaled 224 carries and 57 targets during 15 games at Arizona State. Most of that damage was done in 2021, as he posted a 182-1006-15 rushing line while adding 43-456-1 in the passing game. White's rushing efficiency was pedestrian for the most part, though he eluded tackles at a good rate. He has the look of an impact receiving back in the pros, though he'll struggle for playing time for a while. Leonard Fournette is the Buccaneers' feature back, Giovani Bernard will help in obvious passing situations and 2020 third-round pick Ke'Shawn Vaughn is also in the mix. White doesn't have much season-long value, but is a fine dynasty hold.",

He entered last season as the Falcons' lead back, but progressively lost his grip on the role and ended up outside the top 30 backs in touches and fantasy points despite appearing in 17 games. Davis is well below average in yards per carry (3.7), yards after contact (1.7) and yards per target (5.0) during his seven-year career and the 29-year-old is best utilized as a depth back in the pros. He'll be a long shot for fantasy value barring injuries to JK Dobbins and Gus Edwards.",

He finished third among backs in carries inside the 5 yard line (14) and was also top 10 in routes, receptions, receiving yards. His 19th-place finish in fantasy was his first-career top-60 campaign. Williams' career rushing efficiency is underwhelming, but he's been effective as a receiver and is in a good spot as oft-injured James Conner's primary backup in a productive offense. Standalone value is doubtful, but if Conner misses time, Williams will leap to the RB2/flex radar.",

He is a big, elusive back who contributed as both a rusher (541 carries) and receiver (99 targets) in three seasons at Texas A&M. Spiller's forced missed tackle and YAC profile was very good during his three-season run and his elusiveness really stood out in 2021 (class-best 5.0 evaded tackle rate). Spiller may need some polish in the passing game and he underwhelmed athletically at the combine, but he's also one of the youngest players in the league. The high-scoring Chargers are hunting for a \"big\" back complement to Austin Ekeler and 217-pound Spiller should be the favorite for that role. He'll be an intriguing insurance back as a rookie.",

White is a tough, power runner who impressed at the combine with a 4.40-yard dash (114 speed score) and class-best 128-inch broad jump. The Georgia product has already torn both ACLs, his advanced rushing stats are mediocre and he's a non-factor as a pass catcher (17 catches in three seasons). On the plus side, he was stopped for a loss on a class-low 9% of his carries in 2021. Even if he develops into an effective pro rusher, White is a likely committee back, and usage/production similar to Jordan Howard may be his ceiling. He's buried on the Raiders' 2022 depth chart, but Josh Jacobs is entering a contract year, so White is well worth stashing in dynasty.",

The 2011 first-round pick opened last season in Houston, but was traded back to New Orleans and appeared in four games along with Alvin Kamara. Ingram handled 28 carries (27% share) and nine targets (8%) in those weeks and was 47th in fantasy points during the span. He played two full games with Kamara out and was very effective, producing 100-plus yards and a top-15 fantasy performance both weeks. Ingram isn't a candidate for consistent fantasy production at his age, but with Kamara facing a possible suspension, he could find his way to the RB2/flex radar early in the season. For that reason only, he's worth late-round consideration in drafts.",

        "seasonOutlook": "Foreman signed with Carolina and will compete with Chuba Hubbard for work behind feature back Christian McCaffrey. A third-round pick in 2017, Foreman did not work out in Houston, but enjoyed a career resurgence in Tennessee last season. The 233-pound bulldozer posted a 133-566-3 rushing line and was 25th among RBs in fantasy points during the nine games Derrick Henry was sidelined. Foreman is limited by a lack of receiving work (21 career targets, including 10 last season), but he has some insurance appeal considering McCaffrey's major injury woes the last two seasons. Consider the 26-year-old in the late rounds of deep leagues.",
