        "seasonOutlook": "The Bills selected Davis with a fourth-round pick in 2020 and, while the UCF product has primarily been utilized in a situational role, he's certainly made some noise. Davis averaged 3.9 targets per game during his first 32 games, but found the end zone 13 times and ranked fifth in average depth of target and 11th in yards per target during the span. Despite managing only 35 touches in 2021, he tied for eighth in the league in end zone targets. With Emmanuel Sanders and Cole Beasley gone, Davis is primed for a much larger role in Buffalo's pass-heavy/high-scoring offense in 2022. There's some risk here considering Davis has yet to produce a top-55 fantasy campaign, but he's on a strikingly similar trajectory to Chris Godwin and is a major Year-3 breakout candidate. He's worth a look as a WR3/flex.",

Godwin is now up to nine missed games over the last three seasons (at least two all three years), but the Buccaneers handing him $40 million guaranteed suggests they aren't too concerned. Godwin was his usual, terrific self prior to the injury (seventh at WR in fantasy PPG) and he's been no worse than 15th in PPG each of the last three seasons. Godwin, who has ranked no worse than fourth in catch rate each of the last three seasons, is in his prime at age 26 and benefits from Tampa Bay's pass-heavy, Tom Brady-led offense. We'll need to monitor his health, but Godwin will return to WR1 status when healthy.",

Mahomes continues to produce at an elite level, having tossed at least 37 TDs three of the last four seasons, ranking no lower than sixth in pass attempts, completions, yards and TDs during the last two campaigns. Defenses made drastic changes to try to slow Mahomes down last season, which led to a big dip in average depth of throw and YPA (both were 7.4), but he adjusted, which included a career-high 381 rush yards, and delivered his third top-five fantasy season. Losing Tyreek Hill is not ideal, but Mahomes has an elite skill set, Andy Reid's pass-heavy scheme and a terrific offensive line to work with. He remains an elite fantasy QB.",

        "seasonOutlook": "Herbert already had the look of a long-term fantasy star during an impressive rookie season in 2020, but the Oregon product took his game to another level last season. Herbert finished no lower than third among QBs in pass attempts, completions, yards, TDs and, of course, fantasy points. Herbert's passing output was obviously outstanding, but he also added some value with his legs, ranking top 10 in carries, yards and TDs. Defensive enhancements could lead to less late-game throwing from Herbert this season, but the Chargers operated the game-script-adjusted fourth-pass-heaviest offense last season, and a loaded AFC will mean plenty of close games. Herbert is on the short list of QBs with a strong shot to lead the position in fantasy points this season.",

The Alabama product has handled carry shares of 68%, 66% and 69% in his three seasons and his target shares have progressively increased from 7% to 10% to 12%. Despite missing two games, Jacobs finished no lower than 12th among backs in carries, targets, touches, yards and fantasy points last season. His fantasy production was about as high floor/low ceiling as you can get, as he delivered only two top-10 fantasy weeks, but never fell below 34th in 15 outings. It's possible new coach Josh McDaniels utilizes more of a committee (Kenyan Drake, Ameer Abdullah and Zamir White are on the roster), but Jacobs' role as the lead ball carrier and goal line option keeps the 24-year-old in the RB2 mix.",

        "seasonOutlook": "Expectations generally aren't very high for sixth-round rookies, but Mitchell quickly took control of San Francisco's lead-back gig last season and -- injuries aside -- never gave it back. Including the playoffs, Mitchell appeared in 14 games and carried the ball at least 17 times in 11 of them. He was a top-20 fantasy back in seven of 11 regular-season outings, though his output was limited by a lack of goal-line work (six TDs and four carries inside the 5) and limited passing-game work (20 targets). Nothing about Kyle Shanahan's offense suggests we should expect a major change in role, and new QB Trey Lance may actually steal even more goal-line work. Mitchell's heavy rush volume keeps him in the back-end RB2 mix, but his ceiling is limited.",

The LSU product has missed 10 regular-season games and has yet to produce a top-20 fantasy campaign. Even if we exclude a Week 5 game he left injured last season, Edwards-Helaire ranked 22nd among backs in fantasy PPG. Perhaps even more concerning, he was out-snapped 102-to-35 by Jerick McKinnon during two playoff games together. There's still hope for Edwards-Helaire, as he's only 23 years old and his chief competition for snaps in one of the league's top offenses is newcomer Ronald Jones II. \"CEH\" is safest as a flex, but there's some post-hype appeal here.",

The 2019 third-round pick shared the backfield with Zack Moss and/or Matt Breida for most of last season, but was promoted to feature back duties from Week 14 on. He went on to score at least one TD in six straight games and averaged 19.7 fantasy PPG (that would've ranked fourth among backs during the full regular season). Though he may defer passing work to second-round rookie James Cook this season, Singletary has proven an effective and reliable back and remains positioned for a sizable role in an elite offense. He's a fringe top-25 RB option.",

He holds the unfortunate distinction of having accrued the most touches (163) without scoring at least one TD last season. Sanders has missed nine games due to injury over the last two seasons, but he's been an effective rusher when active, ranking top 15 in yards per carry during each of his three pro seasons. He has, however, struggled as a receiver (4.2 YPT over the last two seasons) and figures to continue deferring some backfield work to Kenneth Gainwell and Boston Scott (not to mention Jalen Hurts). Sanders' TDs will regress to the mean and, if he stays healthy, there's a path to a big rebound season. That said, your safest bet is to target him as a flex.",

He opened the season with a 10-105-1 receiving line on 19 targets in Week 1, but then went on to score one TD and average 56.0 yards per game the rest of the season, missing six games due to injury along the way. He still ended up sixth in fantasy PPG after finishing no lower than third in targets, receptions, yards and fantasy points the prior two seasons. Waller's targets figure to dip some with a new coaching staff and Davante Adams now in the fold, but that can be offset by better luck in the TD department and a bounce-back in the efficiency department. Waller is still in his prime at age 29 and remains a solid TE1.  ",

He is shockingly inconsistent in fantasy for a player of his caliber (two games with 34 or more points, but also six single-digit outings last season) and doesn't see much goal-line work (career-high six TDs and seven EZ targets). Durability has also been an issue, as he's missed at least two games each of the last three seasons (13 total). Despite all of that, he's still finished no worse than fourth in fantasy PPG each of the last four seasons. Kittle's connection with new 49ers' QB Trey Lance is yet to be seen, but, at worst, he's likely to provide mid-range TE1 production.",

        "seasonOutlook": "Jackson is an intriguing wild card, as the four-year veteran's production has taken a hit since his MVP campaign in 2019. After pacing the position in fantasy points and accounting for 43 TDs that season, Jackson fell to 33 TDs and a 10th-place fantasy showing in 2020. Last season, he totaled 18 TDs in 11 full outings and was inactive for five games due to injury. The good news is that he improved his fantasy production when healthy, ranking fifth in fantasy PPG. Jackson remains the class of the position in the rushing department, having finished first or second in carries and rush yards all four seasons as a starter. Losing top receiver Marquise Brown hurts, but Jackson is in his prime (25 years old) and remains a mid-range QB1 with elite upside.  ",

Murray has shown continual improvement in the efficiency department, as his 69% completion rate and 7.9 YPA both ranked top five at the position in 2021. Murray's rushing production took a big dip last season, but he still ranked fourth in carries, yardage and TDs. Murray's supporting cast is as deep as it has ever been, with DeAndre Hopkins, Marquise Brown and Zach Ertz the headliners. In his prime at age 25, Murray remains a solid fantasy QB1.",

        "seasonOutlook": "Cooper was traded to Cleveland after spending his first seven seasons with the Raiders and Cowboys. The 2015 first-round pick has yet to live up to lofty expectations and he hit a bit of a low in 2021 with a career-low 6.9 targets per game (19% share). Cooper has generally been a solid WR2 (he's never finished worse than 29th in fantasy PPG), but he simply hasn't made the leap to WR1 territory (zero season finishes better than 10th). On the plus side, he's only 27 and has a clear path to a hefty target share as Deshaun Watson's top target in Cleveland. A slow start is likely with Watson suspended for 11 games, but Cooper can be viewed as a WR3/flex early on, who could leap into the WR2 mix once Watson is back.",

The lost season came after an injury-plagued 2020 in which he posted a 40-438-0 receiving line in seven games. The string of missed time is extremely unfortunate considering that when we last saw Thomas for a full season (2019), he set the NFL single-season receptions record while posting an incredible 149-1,725-9 receiving line. Thomas had finished four consecutive seasons as a top-seven fantasy WR before 2020. Thomas no longer has Drew Brees throwing him passes, which is sure to decrease his previously terrific efficiency, but Jameis Winston was solid even with a shaky WR room in 2021. Thomas is now 29 years old and riskier than ever, but he remains positioned for a hefty target share, which makes him a fringe WR2 with upside.",

Robinson was held to a 38-410-1 receiving line in 12 games and his efficiency stats were all near the bottom of the league. Robinson is no longer his team's No. 1 wide receiver (Cooper Kupp fills that role in L.A), but he'll be playing with what will easily be the best quarterback (Matthew Stafford) he's had in his career. We need to weigh the possibility that Robinson's best days are behind him, but at age 29 and in such a good situation, a big rebound is very possible. Robinson is on the WR3/flex radar.",

        "seasonOutlook": "Renfrow is entering his fourth NFL season fresh off a breakout 2021in which he finished no lower than 13th among wide receivers in targets, receptions, touchdowns and fantasy points. Renfrow has lived in the short area, ranking in the eighth percentile or lower in average depth of target all three seasons. Of course, his efficiency has been great, as he's second at the position in catch rate and sixth in RAC since he was drafted (min. 200 targets). As good as Renfrow has been, the 26-year-old is ticketed for fewer targets this season with Davante Adams in the mix and Darren Waller back to full health. A repeat top-10 fantasy campaign is unlikely, but Renfrow will see enough work to keep him on the WR3 radar.",

Smith-Schuster has put together three very good pro seasons, the best of which included a 111-1,426-7 receiving line and eighth-place fantasy finish as a 21-year-old in 2018, but he's also had a pair of duds (which included 16 missed games) over the last three seasons. It's fair to wonder if late-career Ben Roethlisberger has been a major culprit for the fall-off, as Smith-Schuster has seen his average depth of target and yards per target plummet the last two seasons. JuJu is still very young (25) and has a path to No. 1 WR duties in the Chiefs' high-scoring, Patrick Mahomes-led offense. He's safest as a WR3/flex, but there's tremendous upside.",

Thielen went down with an injury in Week 13, but not before he continued his scoring dominance. Thielen has an absurd 24 TDs on 202 targets over the last two seasons. He remains positioned for a big role in 2022, but his age and durability (11 missed games over the last three seasons) are red flags and knock him to WR3/flex territory.",

        "seasonOutlook": "A 2021 first-round pick, Bateman missed the first five games of his career due to injury, but was a solid contributor once back to full health. He was a situational player most of the season, and though he did play a full-time role during the final four weeks of the season, Lamar Jackson was out with an injury. Bateman delivered three 80-plus-yard games, though he was severely underutilized near the goal line (three end zone targets), which allowed him only one touchdown and no weekly fantasy finishes better than 18th. With Marquise Brown gone, Bateman has a clear path to No. 1 wide receiver duties and joins Mark Andrews as Jackson's clear top-two targets. The 22-year-old is a major breakout candidate and can be considered a WR3 with upside.",

        "seasonOutlook": "London was selected by Atlanta with the eighth overall pick in April's draft. London is a 6-foot-4, possession receiver who lacks speed, but makes up for it with size and terrific ball skills. He aligned in the slot 96% of the time during his first two seasons at USC, but flipped to 85% perimeter in 2021 and enjoyed a breakout campaign. He handled a massive 38% target share when active, which allowed an 88-1,084-7 receiving line during a season cut short by a broken ankle. London is one of the youngest players entering the league, but he's set for an immediate every-down role in an Atlanta offense that badly needed WR help. The Falcons' QB situation is a concern, but London will see enough targets to warrant weekly WR3/flex consideration, at least.",

The 2018 second-round pick is coming off the best season of his career, though he appeared in all 17 games and still wasn't better than 20th in targets, receptions, yards, TDs or fantasy points. Kirk's salary suggests he'll be a featured target, but he'll need a big leap from Trevor Lawrence and more goal-line work (22 career end zone targets) in order to produce his first career top-25 fantasy campaign. The 25-year-old is in the WR3/flex mix.",

The 2015 third-round pick is on the small side (5-foot-10, 182 pounds), but a lot of his damage has been done in the touchdown department (at least eight in each of the last four seasons). Lockett has also been very efficient, ranking fifth in catch rate (72.4%) and sixth in YPT (9.8) since he entered the league. Of course, it's fair to worry about both scoring and efficiency with Russell Wilson out and Drew Lock in at quarterback. Lockett is very talented and will see plenty of targets, but the QB downgrade is a major concern and bumps the 29-year-old down to WR3 territory.",

Smith ranked eighth at the position in average depth of target (14.0) and finished in the 80th percentile or better in both catch rate and yards per target over expected. Smith looks the part of a star receiver, but he'll be hard-pressed to see a big boost in targets after the acquisition of A.J. Brown and with the Eagles seemingly committed to the run with Jalen Hurts under center. The 23-year-old is best viewed as a WR3/flex and can be upgraded a bit in non-PPR formats.",

His career got off to a bit of a slow start (9-79-0 receiving line through Week 7), but then the light went on. During Weeks 8-13, Moore racked up 494 yards and five TDs on 38 touches. His 18.9 fantasy PPG during the span was seventh best among wide receivers. A Week 13 quad injury ended Moore's season early, but not before we saw his high ceiling. Moore is a bit undersized and has more competition for targets (most notably first-round pick Garrett Wilson), but he's on the rise at age 22 and should benefit from a probable second-year leap from QB Zach Wilson. Moore is best viewed as a WR3/flex.",

The 2020 second-round pick was outside the top 20 in passing yards and TDs last season, but he made up for it by pacing the position in carries, rushing yards and rushing TDs. The rushing prowess helped him to a healthy 20.0 fantasy PPG, which ranked seventh at the position. Hurts will benefit from a respectable supporting cast that includes an elite offensive line and standout targets A.J. Brown, DeVonta Smith and Dallas Goedert. Hurts remains a work in progress as a passer, which makes his seat quite hotter than your usual QB1 target, but his elite rushing ability supplies him with top-five fantasy upside.",

He followed with a full-on breakout last season, leaping to a 78-808-8 line and a third-place fantasy finish. Schultz has now finished top five among tight ends in snaps, routes and receptions reach of the last two seasons. Granted, he was a bit lucky in the TD department last season (5.2 expected TDs and five end zone targets), but Schultz will remain one of Dak Prescott's primary targets, especially with Amari Cooper and Cedrick Wilson gone and Michael Gallup recovering from a torn ACL. Schultz enters his age-26 campaign as a fringe top-five fantasy tight end.",

Hockenson has finished seventh in fantasy PPG each of the last two seasons and the 25-year-old is one of the league's top young talents.

        "seasonOutlook": "Hunt is back for his fourth season in Cleveland after a lost 2021 campaign in which he was a full go for only six games. Despite sharing backfield duties with Nick Chubb, Hunt has been a productive fantasy back over the last two seasons. He was 11th among all RBs in fantasy points during six full games with Chubb in 2021 and was 13th in 11 games in 2020. Hunt has generally been limited to around one-third of the carries with Chubb in the mix, but his elite efficiency (NFL-best 2.4 YAC since he was drafted) and passing-game involvement have been enough to allow strong fantasy output. Hunt is safest as a flex target, but he has added value as one of the top insurance backs in the game.",

He played his first significant snaps in Week 5 and was 40th in fantasy points from that point forward, though most of his damage came in two games (both 100-yard, 2-TD efforts). Unless Damien Harris was sidelined due to injury, Stevenson worked in a three-man committee, and that may not change this season. Harris is the team's lead rusher and goal-line option and New England could utilize Ty Montgomery or Pierre Strong Jr. as a passing-down specialist. Perhaps Stevenson will secure enough carries and targets for consistent flex value, but his ceiling will likely be limited in this scheme.",

        "seasonOutlook": "Harris is entering his third NFL season after producing his first top-15 fantasy campaign in 2021. Nearly all of Harris' production was generated on the ground, as he ranked 10th among backs in rushing yards, but 62nd in targets. He was especially busy at the goal line, finishing second in rushing TDs (15) and third in carries inside the 5-yard line (14). Harris has been an effective rusher (career 4.8 YPC, 1.9 YAC), but he averaged 13.0 carries and 1.1 targets per game once Rhamondre Stevenson stepped into a sizable role, and that was with James White on IR. Stevenson and perhaps a passing-down specialist (Ty Montgomery? Pierre Strong?) will be factors this season and Harris is a strong TD regression candidate. His low ceiling (he had two weekly finishes better than 14th last season) limits him to flex territory.",

        "seasonOutlook": "Pierce was selected by Houston in the fourth round of April's draft. He is a strong, explosive back capable of producing as a rusher and receiver. He showed well in terms of forcing missed tackles and after contact (3.6), picked up 10-plus yards on a class-best 20% of his carries and showed pass-catching prowess by hauling in all 19 catchable targets and averaging 10.8 yards per target. Pierce seems to have major upside, but lacks top-end speed (4.59 40-yard dash) and it's fair to wonder if he'll be viewed as a three-down back after never clearing 106 carries or 23 targets during four seasons at Florida. He has a shot at rookie-season fantasy relevance, but he'll need to overtake Marlon Mack and Rex Burkhead on the depth chart. He's a fine late-round flier.",

Edmonds is ticketed for a similar role in Miami, which will mean deferring a sizable chunk of the carries to Raheem Mostert and Sony Michel while focusing primarily on passing-game work. Edmonds' ceiling is limited but he'll be on the weekly PPR flex radar in Miami's much-improved offense.",

        "seasonOutlook": "Gibson's 2021 season can easily be split into two parts. One encompassing the first 11 games, all of which were played with a healthy J.D. McKissic. Gibson handled 16.6 carries and 2.7 targets and was fantasy's No. 17 RB during the span. The second part was the five games after McKissic's season-ending injury, during which Gibson averaged 15.0 carries and 4.6 targets and was sixth in fantasy points. In total, Gibson ended up no lower than eighth in touches, yards and touchdowns. McKissic is back and Washington inexplicably drafted Brian Robinson Jr. in the third round, so it's fair to think Gibson will be limited as a receiver and at the goal line. Nonetheless, he's still the team's lead back and only 24 years old, so it's possible we've yet to see his best work. He remains in the RB2 mix.",

Patterson was limited as a rusher, however, and didn't hold up for the entire season. In fact, he was seventh among RBs in fantasy points through Week 14, but failed to deliver a top-30 outing over the final four weeks. Now 31 years old, Patterson figures to remain in a time-share, though Atlanta's lack of offensive playmakers may again force him into a sizable role. He's best viewed as a flex option.",

Despite the \"backup\" designation, Pollard's role has progressively increased each of the last three seasons and led to his first top-30 fantasy campaign in 2021. Pollard's volume was underwhelming (36th at RB in touches), but his efficiency was elite as both a rusher (5.5 YPC and 2.7 YAC were both top five) and receiver (87% catch rate and 7.5 YPT were both top 10). The 25-year-old has little standalone value (he had one weekly finish better than 15th last season), but he's an elite insurance option, as he'd leap into RB1 territory if Elliott were to miss time.",

He has yet to clear five TDs in a single season, but he's been top 12 in fantasy PPG each of the last three seasons. The Eagles operate a run-heavy offense, but Goedert should be a clear third in target priority behind A.J. Brown and DeVonta Smith. The 27-year-old is a mid-to-back-end TE1.",

The 2013 second-round pick handled a 21% target share (7.5 per game) and was sixth in fantasy PPG during 11 games with Arizona. After finishing third at the position in total and end zone (10) targets last season, Ertz returns as one of Kyler Murray's top targets in 2022.

        "seasonOutlook": "After missing most of the 2020 season due to injury, Prescott bounced back in a big way last season, tossing a career-high 37 TDs while finishing top 10 in completion percentage (69%), YPA (7.5) and fantasy points. Prescott was more boom/bust than other top fantasy QBs, as he produced nine top-10 weeks (tied for fifth), but also five finishes of 20th or worse. A reason for that was a concerning dip in rushing, as his carries, rush yards and rushing TDs were all easily career-low marks in full seasons. Amari Cooper may be gone, but Prescott still has a good supporting cast led by CeeDee Lamb and he leads a pass-heavy offense. The drop in rushing limits his upside a bit, but Prescott remains a solid QB1.",

The GOAT attempted 719 passes last season, which is the second most in a single season in NFL history. He also paced the league in completions, passing yardage and passing TDs, and only two QBs scored more fantasy points. Bruce Arians is out and Todd Bowles in as head coach, which could lead to more offensive balance, but it's no accident that seven of Brady's last eight offenses have been pass-first (if not extremely pass-heavy). Brady is 45 years old and doesn't offer much with his legs (81 yards last season), but he's still playing at an elite level, won't be short volume and has a good group of targets. We should expect a slight step back this season, but Brady remains a solid fantasy starter.",

Rodgers' production actually took a step back last season compared to 2020 (TDs down from 48 to 37 and fantasy PPG down from 24.0 to 20.8), but he still managed a top-five fantasy campaign thanks to the big TD total and elite efficiency (top six in YPA and completion percentage for the second straight season). Adams' departure is undoubtedly a concern for Rodgers' fantasy upside, but considering he's finished no worse than ninth in fantasy PPG 13 of the last 14 seasons, it's fair to expect his elite talent to lead to yet another QB1 campaign.",

        "seasonOutlook": "Wilson was traded to Denver after 10 seasons in Seattle. The move comes after a down fantasy year for Wilson, as a three-game injury absence ended a streak of eight straight top-10 fantasy campaigns. Wilson still played pretty well when active, though, finishing as a top-10 fantasy QB in 50% of his appearances (ninth highest). Wilson's rushing output was way down last season (career-low 43 carries and 183 yards), but he brings an aggressive game to Denver, having finished no lower than seventh in average depth of throw four of the last five seasons. Wilson is still in his prime at age 33 and he has a pretty good supporting cast led by Courtland Sutton, Jerry Jeudy and Javonte Williams. He's a fine mid-range QB1 target.",

His weekly splits are a bit alarming, as he did most of his damage in three games (two against a beat-up Baltimore team). Burrow scored 32% of his fantasy points in those three games, which marked his only weekly finishes better than eighth for the season. That's a concern, but he has the benefit of arguably the league's best WR room, and an overhauled offensive line will help his cause after he took a league-high 51 sacks in 2021. Burrow's ceiling is a bit capped by limited rushing contributions (40-118-2 rushing line in 2021), but his elite passing production keeps him in the QB1 mix.",

        "seasonOutlook": "Stafford's first season in Los Angeles resulted in a Lombardi Trophy and he was rewarded with an offseason contract extension. It also resulted in the sixth-most fantasy points at the position, as Stafford finished no lower than eighth in pass attempts, completions, yards, TDs and yards per attempt. There's some survival bias baked into Stafford's sixth-place finish -- he was 11th in fantasy PPG -- and it can't be ignored that he's a nonfactor as a rusher (his last rushing TD came in 2016). That said, Stafford operates in Sean McVay's pass-heavy scheme and has a good supporting cast led by Cooper Kupp and Allen Robinson II. The 34-year-old reigning Super Bowl MVP is best viewed as a back-end QB1.",

Toney's high point came in a Week 5 game in which he racked up 189 yards, the seventh-most by a rookie in a single game during the last 20 seasons. Toney didn't see much goal-line work (zero TDs, two end zone targets) and was primarily used in the short area (6.4 aDOT), though he made up a ton of ground with the ball in his hands (6.0 RAC ranked 10th). Durability and New York's QB situation are concerns, but Toney has elite playmaking ability and a new coach in Brian Daboll. Target him as a flex with major breakout potential.",

The 2018 UDFA is coming off career-high marks in all the key categories -- targets, receptions, receiving yards, touchdowns and fantasy points -- but that was only enough for a 47th-place finish. Lazard was busy near the goal line (he tied for eighth in the NFL with 12 end zone targets), but he missed two games due to injury, bringing him to eight over the last two seasons. All that said, Lazard is only 26 years old and has a path to a much-larger role with Davante Adams' massive target share out of the way. A healthy Lazard could conceivably lead the Aaron Rodgers-led Packers in targets, so he can't be ignored as a late-round flier.",

During Weeks 1-7, Aiyuk averaged 2.7 targets per game, but that jumped to 6.2 during his final 11 outings and he was 24th in fantasy points during the stretch. The 2020 first-round pick has finished exactly 35th in fantasy points during each of his first two seasons, but with Deebo Samuel now playing a hybrid RB/WR role, Aiyuk should be all but cemented into a substantial role. The 49ers' QB change to Trey Lance adds some uncertainty, but also some upside. Aiyuk, who was top 10 in yards per target and RAC last season, is a flex option.",

The Ohio State product is a quick and elusive prospect who primarily worked as a perimeter receiver and punt returner at OSU. Wilson has terrific hands, having dropped only six balls during his college career and posting a strong 90% catch rate on on-target throws in 2021. That 2021 campaign included a terrific 70-1058-12 receiving line in 11 games. Wilson figures to immediately slide in as a starter opposite second-year Elijah Moore, with Corey Davis and Braxton Berrios also in the fold. Wilson has more competition for targets than many of his fellow rookies, but history tells us top-10 rookie WRs are a strong bet to see big volume and provide weekly WR3/flex production.",

Woods reeled off three-straight top-15 fantasy campaigns during 2018-20 and was lower than 13th among wide receivers in snaps, routes, targets and receptions during each campaign. He was on his way to another solid year in 2021 (16th in fantasy PPG despite a slow start), but a torn ACL ended his season after nine games. Woods is past his prime at age-30, not much of a TD scorer (career-high is six TDs) and is now moving to one of the league's run-heaviest offenses.

        "seasonOutlook": "Hopkins is back for his third season in Arizona, though he's suspended for the first six games. This comes after a lost 2021 campaign in which he was limited to 10 games due to injury. It was an odd season for Hopkins, as he was seeing career-low usage (6.1 targets per game after averaging 9.1 per game during 2015-20), but was on a career-best TD pace (WR-high 13.1% TD rate more than doubled his 5.4% career rate). We should expect TD regression, but Hopkins is always busy near the goal line (top 12 in end zone targets each of the last seven seasons) and remains a super-reliable target (19 drops in 136 games). Hopkins can get back to fantasy WR 1/2 status once his suspension ends, but he's now 30 years old and will miss nearly half of the fantasy regular season. He's only worth considering in the middle rounds.",
