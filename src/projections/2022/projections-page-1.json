        "seasonOutlook": "Taylor returns as the feature back in Indianapolis after leading the position in fantasy points, carries, yards and TDs during a breakout 2021 season. Taylor's season started and ended slowly (zero top-10 fantasy outings during Weeks 1-3 and 16-18), but it was as good as it gets in the middle (11 straight top-10s during Weeks 4-15). Taylor found the end zone 20 times and his 26 carries inside the opponent's 5-yard line were the most the league had seen in a single season since 2012. An uptick in passing-game work would be nice (unlikely with Nyheim Hines in the mix), but Taylor's age (23), massive usage in a run-heavy offense and top-end efficiency are plenty enough to allow continued elite production. He should be the first pick in 2022 fantasy drafts.",

After not missing a single game and playing 85% of the snaps during his first three NFL seasons, McCaffrey has been limited to 10 games over the last two seasons. The good news is that McCaffrey is only 26 years old and has remained extremely productive when active. Excluding two games he left injured in 2021, McCaffrey was a top-15 fantasy RB in all five \"full\" games he played. Despite missing more than half the season, he finished 15th among RBs in receiving yards. McCaffrey remains the feature back in Carolina and 200-plus carries and 90-plus receptions is attainable. Durability is an obvious concern, but McCaffrey's elite per-game production makes him hard to pass on in the top five in 2022 fantasy drafts.",

Is that good? It seems good. Kupp outscored the next-closest wide receiver by 96 fantasy points and finished a ridiculous 15 of 17 weeks as a top-12 scorer at the position. Kupp continues to dominate after the catch, ranking top 12 in RAC in each of his five NFL seasons. It's reasonable to expect Kupp to come back to earth this season, especially considering he's now 29 years old and has missed action in three of five NFL seasons, but he's still a lock for a substantial target share in one of the league's top offenses. He should be off the board early in Round 1.",

Ekeler had the highest floor at the position, as he was the only back to produce at least 9.5 fantasy points in every game he played. He was very lucky in the TD department (20 TDs, 11.1 expected) and will regress, but he sees more than enough volume to remain a top fantasy back (14th in carries and second in targets among RBs in 2021). In his prime at age 27 and working in one of the league's top-scoring offenses, Ekeler is well positioned for his third top-three fantasy campaign in four seasons.",

The 2020 first-round pick finished no lower than fifth among wide receivers in snaps, routes, targets, receptions, receiving yards and fantasy points. Jefferson was busy as both a vertical target (his 2,082 air yards led the NFL) and near the goal line (his 15 end zone targets ranked second). The 23-year-old will be working in a new offense this season under Kevin O'Connell, but we can still expect roughly 30% of Kirk Cousins' throws to head in Jefferson's direction. He's an elite fantasy option.",

        "seasonOutlook": "The Bengals selected Chase with the fifth overall pick of the 2021 draft and the LSU product immediately stepped into fantasy stardom. Chase was probably below where you expected in the target department (18th among WRs with 127), but averaging 11.5 yards per target (second highest) and 8.1 yards after the catch (fourth highest) was enough for him to gain 1,455 yards (fourth most). Chase was also busy near the goal line (his 13 end zone targets ranked fifth), which allowed 13 TDs and the fifth-most fantasy points at the position. Chase is only 22 years old and we likely haven't seen his best season. Joe Burrow's top target is a high-end WR1.",

He remained one of the most-utilized players in the league prior to the injury, appearing  in nine games and handling at least 80% of Tennessee's designed runs in all nine. That's a rare feat, but not surprising for a player who handled more than 75% when active the prior two seasons. Henry's age (28) is a concern, but he was still extremely productive last season (fantasy's top-scoring RB by 40 points through Week 8) and was well on his way to crushing his previous career-high receiving numbers. His path to a massive workload in one of the league's run-heaviest offenses remains intact. Consider Henry a solid RB1.",

Volume was the name of the game for Harris last season, as he finished second among RBs in carries and first in snaps, touches, routes, targets and receptions. Harris' efficiency (3.9 YPC, 5.0 YPT) was ugly and his TD total (10) didn't quite align with his usage, but a lot of that can be blamed on a low-scoring offense and a poor offensive line. The latter is a bit better heading into 2022, though the team's QB situation remains a major question mark. Of course, volume is king and 24-year-old Harris is positioned for a similar role this season. He's a solid RB1 with elite upside.",

        "seasonOutlook": "Kamara is entering his sixth NFL season in search of his sixth consecutive top-10 fantasy campaign. The good news is that he's positioned as New Orleans' lead back and will remain a featured target in the pass game (he's never finished lower than fifth among RBs in targets). There are concerns, however. Kamara's efficiency took a big hit without Drew Brees around last season (career-low 3.74 YPC and 66% catch rate) and he's unlikely to hold up for 17 games (he's missed at least one game each of the last four seasons). Kamara is also in jeopardy of a multi-game suspension for an offseason arrest. The 27-year-old is a strong bet for RB1 production when active, but he'll be a risky early-round investment until his off-field situation is resolved.",

Cook missed four games (none consecutively) and has never appeared in more than 14 regular-season games in a single season. Cook still enjoyed plenty of volume (top 10 among RBs in touches and yards for the third straight season), but he took a major dive in the scoring department (six TDs after totaling 30 during 2019 and '20) and saw a career-low 3.7 targets per game. Cook is still in his prime at age 27, but his extensive missed time can't be ignored. He's a mid-range RB1.",

        "seasonOutlook": "Adams was traded to the Raiders after spending his first eight seasons with the Packers. One of the safest players in fantasy for more than a half decade, Adams has finished no worse than 10th in fantasy PPG each of the last six seasons. That includes three top-three finishes in fantasy points over the last four seasons. Adams is an elite talent and he'll still be heavily targeted by college teammate Derek Carr, but we obviously need to lower expectations a bit. Carr is solid, but he's not Aaron Rodgers and we also can't assume he'll be in the 97th percentile in target share, which is where he's been the past four seasons. Adams also has more competition for targets, he's now 29 years old and he tends to miss the occasional game or two. It's safest to view Adams as a mid-range WR1 rather than the elite play he's been in recent years.",

The 2019 second-round pick worked almost exclusively as a wide receiver through his first eight games and was second at the position in fantasy PPG. He then flipped to a RB/WR hybrid role, with his targets dipping from 10.0 to 4.9 per game and his carries increasing from 0.8 to 6.6 per game. He was fourth in fantasy PPG during the span. Samuel finished no lower than second in yards per reception, yards per target, yards per route run and top-10 fantasy weeks. He is nothing short of an elite playmaker, as he's averaging 6.2 yards per carry and a WR-best 9.7 RAC since he was drafted. Samuel's new role as a ballcarrier raises durability concerns, but the 26-year-old will undoubtedly be an elite fantasy option on a week-to-week basis.",

He saw a career-high 20 end zone targets, which was five more than any other player in the league. Diggs' efficiency took a massive dive (which aligned with Josh Allen's drop), but that was more than offset by overwhelming volume in a pass-heavy, high-scoring offense. Diggs signed a long-term extension during the offseason, which locks him in as Allen's top target. The 28-year-old remains a solid WR1.",

Mixon's fourth-place fantasy finish marks his third top 15 over the last four seasons. The former second-round pick isn't used a ton in the pass game, but he benefits from substantial volume in the run game (third in total carries and carries inside the 5-yard line last season). A lost 2020 season aside, Mixon's durability has been good and he's still in his prime at age 26. The Bengals' offense was very good in 2021 and an improved offensive line will only make it better this season. Mixon is a fine RB1.",

Through 11 weeks, Swift had been on the field for 72% of Detroit's snaps and was handling a hefty 13.7 carries and 6.7 targets per game. Swift ranked first at the position in targets and receptions and only four backs had more fantasy points during the span. Durability is a minor concern here, as Swift has missed seven games in two seasons, but he's only 23 years old and remains positioned for a large offensive role behind one of the league's top lines. Swift's Alvin Kamara-like usage supplies him with top-five fantasy upside and locks him into the RB1 mix.",

Target share has been a problem (he's finished 48th and 36th at the position in the two seasons) and has left him without a top-15 fantasy campaign. The good news is that Lamb has been very effective when targeted (80th percentile or better in YPT, YPRR and RAC last season) and more volume is available after Amari Cooper was traded and with Michael Gallup recovering from a torn ACL. Only 23, Lamb is still ascending and everything is in place for a big leap forward in 2022. Target him as your WR1.",

        "seasonOutlook": "Hill was traded to Miami after finishing four of his six seasons in Kansas City as a top-eight fantasy wide receiver. He is coming off a bit of an odd season, as defensive adjustments led to more short-area work (10.6 aDOT was his lowest since 2016) and a dip in scoring (nine TDs), but also a career-high 160 targets and 111 receptions. His fantasy production was boom/bust, as he produced five top-10 fantasy weeks, but also eight finishes of 40th or worse. Hill is now 28 years old and his value takes a hit with Tua Tagovailoa under center rather than Patrick Mahomes. Still, he's one of the league's most explosive and heavily utilized players. He's a mid-range WR1.",

He was a fantasy star prior to suffering an injury in Week 15 that cost him the rest of the regular season. Through 14 games, only Jonathan Taylor and Austin Ekeler had more fantasy points. Even including the missed time, Fournette finished top 10 among backs in yards and TDs and was no lower than fourth in routes, targets, receptions and receiving yards. With Tom Brady back and minimal competition for touches, Fournette is fully expected to play a similar role in 2022. He's in his prime at 27 years old and is well positioned for his fourth top-10 fantasy campaign in six NFL seasons.",

        "seasonOutlook": "Andrews enters his fifth NFL season fresh off a career yearin which he led all tight ends in targets, receptions, yardage, touchdowns and end zone targets (14). Andrews was fantasy's top-scoring TE by 38 points, though it's worth noting his splits with/without Lamar Jackson. In 11 games with Jackson, Andrews averaged 7.9 targets and 14.9 fantasy PPG (four top-five weeks). In six games with Jackson out, Andrews averaged 10.8 targets and 22.9 fantasy PPG (top five all six weeks). This suggests Andrews may not continue his late-season surge, but the departure of Marquise Brown locks him into a massive target share. Also, he has never finished lower than fifth at the position in average depth of target and he's been top two in end zone targets each of the last three seasons. Andrews is an elite fantasy asset and positioned for his fourth straight top-six fantasy campaign.",

        "seasonOutlook": "Williams is primed for a sophomore-year leap after splitting Denver's backfield with Melvin Gordon as a rookie last season. The 2021 second-round pick played 51% of the snaps and was effective as both a rusher (2.57 YAC ranked seventh) and pass-catcher (43 receptions, 13th among RBs). Williams showed his elite upside during the one week Gordon was sidelined, exploding for 178 yards and one TD on 29 touches. Gordon is back, but a reduced role is likely at age 29, especially with a new coaching staff in place. Williams, meanwhile, is very young (22), can contribute as both a rusher and receiver and will benefit from an offense that will be more productive with Russell Wilson under center. Williams has an elite ceiling and should be viewed as a fringe RB1.",

Kelce finished first at the position in routes, touchdowns and top-10 fantasy weeks, as well as second in targets, receptions and yards. It was another tremendous season, but there are concerns. Kelce's snaps have been trending down in recent years and, in 2021, he posted a career-low catch rate (68%) and yards per target (8.3), as well as his lowest target share since 2016 (22%). He also matched a career low with four end zone targets. Kelce will turn 33 this year, but he's still a featured target (perhaps more so with Tyreek Hill gone) in an elite, pass-heavy offense. Kelce remains a top-two fantasy TE.",

        "seasonOutlook": "Conner re-signed with Arizona and, with Chase Edmonds no longer in the mix, he's now the team's clear-cut feature back. We saw Conner in that role for six weeks last season and the results were impressive. He totaled 665 yards and 10 TDs on 130 touches, trailing only Jonathan Taylor in fantasy points during the span. Of course, Conner was productive even with Edmonds active thanks to heavy usage near the goal line. Conner registered 12 carries from opponent's 1-yard line, which was three more than any other player. He finished no lower than third among RBs in TDs (18), expected TDs (11.8) and carries inside the 5-yard line (16). Probable TD regression is likely to be offset by more touches, so 27-year-old Conner is very much on the RB1 radar and has top-five upside.",

Excluding the two games Jones missed last season, Jones had 183 carries (46% share) and 75 targets (14%), compared to 169 carries (42%) and 30 targets (6%) for AJ Dillon. Jones finished as a top-12 fantasy RB for the third year in a row, though his rushing production was down considerably. Durability is a concern here, as Jones has missed at least two regular-season games during four of his five NFL campaigns. Jones will, at least, split the carries and is heavily involved in the passing game in one of the league's top offenses, so even with some concerns, the 27-year-old remains a fringe RB1.",

He has caught at least 97 passes in five consecutive seasons and has finished no worse than 13th in fantasy points during the span. He's not a big-time TD scorer (he's never cleared eight in a season), but reliability (three missed games over the last five seasons) and heavy short-area usage have allowed consistent top-end production. Age is starting to become a concern here, as Allen is entering his 10th NFL season at age 30, but he continues to defy the odds, having been the only WR in his age-29 season or later to finish in the top 25 in fantasy points last season. Justin Herbert's top target is a solid WR2.",

Higgins was a viable WR3 with a 67-908-6 receiving line as a rookie before making a leap to WR2 territory with a 74-1,091-6 line in 14 games last season. Ja'Marr Chase has emerged as Cincinnati's top offensive player, but Higgins is utilized just as often. When the two were active with Tyler Boyd last season (18 games), Higgins handled 140 targets (23% share), compared to 144 (24%) for Chase. Higgins' ceiling is capped slightly by Chase, but this offense can support two top-12 fantasy WRs. Higgins is a fringe WR1 in his age-23 campaign.",

In 2021, Evans missed a game-and-a-half, but still paced the position in routes (616) and scored 14 TDs despite ranking outside the top 20 in targets, receptions and yards. Evans is entering his age-29 season and a larger target share would be ideal, but the Tampa Bay offense is so fantasy friendly that he's still a fringe WR1.",

The culprit was, once again, touchdowns. Moore is the only player in NFL history with at least 1,100 receiving yards and fewer than five TDs in more than two seasons (he's done it each of the last three seasons). Still, the 25-year-old is heavily targeted (sixth at WR last season) and has overcome weak QB play to finish top 10 in receiving yards each of the past three seasons. He's a solid WR2 and, with any luck in the TD department, he could leap even higher, especially with Baker Mayfield now under center.",

        "seasonOutlook": "It's been a downward spiral for Barkley since he paced all running backs in fantasy points as a rookie in 2018. The Penn State product followed that up with a 10th-place finish (three missed games) in 2019 before missing all but two games due to injury in 2020. A pair of early-season top-10 outings last season had Barkley back on track, but a freak Week 5 ankle injury cost him four games and he never quite bounced back. Perhaps the new coaching regime will re-ignite Barkley's career -- he's only 25 years old and has minimal competition for touches -- but the rough 2021 efficiency and 21 missed games over the last three seasons means we must lower expectations. Barkley is best viewed as a mid-range RB2.",

The 2020 second-round pick first took on lead-back duties in Week 13 of the 2020 season and, since that point, he's played a substantial role in 10 games. During those outings, he's averaging 19.9 carries and 2.4 targets per game. Akers failed to impress off his surprising return from the Achilles injury during the playoffs (2.6 YPC), but he's only 23 years old and figures to be much closer to full strength come Week 1. Akers may be limited as a pass-catcher (especially with Darrell Henderson Jr. in the fold), but he's the lead back in an offense that is second in the league in carries inside the 5 since Sean McVay joined the team in 2017. Akers is a major breakout candidate.",

Pittman appeared in all 17 games and, despite working in the Colts' run-heavy offense, finished no lower than 17th among receivers in targets, receptions, yards, touchdowns and fantasy points. Perhaps Matt Ryan's arrival will get Pittman to the next level, but his ceiling does appear a bit capped by the scheme, as well as a role that hasn't allowed much goal line work (39th with seven end zone targets in 2021) or many deep routes (9.6 aDOT was in the bottom third at the position). Pittman is a mid-range WR2.",

The 2019 second-round pick has emerged as one of the league's top WR talents in recent years, but he just can't seem to get over the top and join the elite fantasy scorers at the position. Part of the issue was Tennessee's run-heavy scheme, but it's also related to the six games he's missed due to injury over the last two seasons. The good news is that Brown has seen big target shares (seventh at WR each of the last two seasons), has been a TD machine (24 TDs in 43 games) and his efficiency has been elite (no lower than seventh in YPT, RAC and YPRR since he was drafted). He is safest as a fantasy WR2, but he'll be Jalen Hurts' primary target in Philadelphia and has a shot at his second top-12 fantasy campaign.",

McLaurin is extremely reliable (four career drops) and, though his role as a speed/vertical target limits his catch total a bit, it sets him up for plenty of explosive plays (his 14.4 average depth of route led all WRs in 2021). The arrival of Carson Wentz has McLaurin positioned for his first fantasy campaign better than 20th. Target the 26-year-old as a WR2.",

That has allowed three straight top-12 finishes in fantasy PPG despite seven missed games and minimal involvement as a pass-catcher (his 123 targets since being drafted ranks 37th among RBs). Chubb has handled an underwhelming 55% of the carries and 5% of targets during 17 games with Kareem Hunt over the last two seasons, but high-end efficiency and TD numbers have allowed RB1 production during the stretch. That's unlikely to be sustainable, but the Cleveland offense should be improved when Deshaun Watson is under center late in the season. Chubb is safest as a mid-range RB2 and can be upgraded in non-PPR.",

His fantasy success has been extremely volume-based, as he sits fourth in targets (314) but also third lowest in yards per target (6.64) among WRs with 120-plus targets over the last two seasons. For better and for worse, Johnson's output was affected substantially by late-career Ben Roethlisberger, who has since retired. The QB change makes Johnson's 2022 outlook a bit cloudy, but even if his target share dips, his downfield work very well could rise. The 25-year-old is one of the best separators in the game and a solid WR2 target.",

The 2021 sixth overall pick finished no lower than 10th at the position in targets, receptions and catch rate in his inaugural season. Waddle's upside was limited a bit by his short-area role (7.0 aDOT was in the 10th percentile) and a lack of goal line work (three end zone targets), but he still managed a strong 14th-place fantasy finish. Waddle appears to be the real deal, though he may have trouble making a leap forward in 2022 with Tyreek Hill added to the fold. Coach Mike McDaniel will surely make plenty use of Waddle, but barring major progress from Tua Tagovailoa, the 23-year-old is best viewed as a good WR2.",

        "seasonOutlook": "Williams enters 2022 fresh off a breakout campaign in which he posted his first-career top-30 fantasy campaign (12th), which landed him a pricey offseason contract extension. Williams saw more high-percentage targets last season, but still ranked among the top 15 receivers in yards per reception and end zone targets for the fourth consecutive season. One concern is that, after a hot start, Williams reverted to his pre-2021 usage and production. During Weeks 1-5, he had a 26% target share and was the No. 2 fantasy WR. After that, he saw a 19% share and was WR25. In total, he had eight top-20 fantasy outings, but was 40th or worse in his other eight games. Of course, Williams is one of standout QB Justin Herbert's top two targets in one of the league's best offenses. That keeps him in the WR2 discussion.",

Oh, and he's done it with four different teams. Cooks hasn't been a big factor in the TD department (he's been under seven TDs each of the last four seasons), but that's been easily offset by high-end efficiency (career 9.2 yards per target) and target shares (25% over last two seasons). Houston's QB situation remains a question mark, but he and projected starter Davis Mills had a solid connection last season (69-736-5 receiving line on 96 targets). Cooks remains an underrated WR2.",

        "seasonOutlook": "Pitts is entering his second NFL season after an impressive rookie campaignin which he finished no lower than sixth among tight ends in routes, targets, yards and fantasy points as a 20-year-old. Pitts was utilized as a vertical threat, ranking first among TEs in average depth of target (10.8) and third in yards per target (9.3). Pitts' season would've had more fanfare if not for extremely little opportunity and luck near the goal line. He was limited to five end zone targets, but his one TD was still well below his expected total (5.1). The Atlanta offense is in rough shape, but Pitts has the look of a superstar and he'll be force-fed targets. Add in some inevitable TD regression to the mean and Pitts is a top-end TE1 with an elite ceiling.",

After underwhelming as a rookie in 2019, Montgomery has been much better the last two seasons and the volume has followed suit (16.9 carries and 4.3 targets per game during 2020-21). He's always busy near the goal line, ranking fifth with 36 carries inside the 5 since entering the league. Montgomery has finished top 15 in fantasy PPG the last two seasons and is positioned for very similar usage in 2022. The 25-year-old is a solid RB2 with back-end RB1 upside.",

He is a well-built, three-down back who racked up 3,044 yards and 41 TDs on 532 carries during his final two seasons at Iowa State. Hall has passing-game chops, having caught 93 passes during three FBS seasons, and he rushed for a TD in an NCAA-record 24 consecutive games to finish his career. He's one of the youngest backs in this year's rookie class and he crushed the combine, running a 4.39 40-yard dash and posting a class-best 40-inch vert and 126-inch broad jump. Hall profiles as a potential feature back with a high fantasy ceiling, though Michael Carter will remain involved, especially in the passing game. Hall's combination of talent and opportunity should land him in the RB2 mix in 2022.",

Elliott finished seventh among RBs in fantasy points, but the result reeks of survivor bias. Elliott had one weekly finish better than eighth (Week 3) and finished outside the top-20 backs in six of the final 11 weeks. Elliott averaged a career-low 13.9 carries per game, but still finished top 10 among backs in carries, rushing yards, rushing TDs, carries inside the 5, routes, targets and receptions. Elliott has finished all six NFL seasons as a top-12 fantasy back, but he's been outside the top 15 in PPG each of the last two seasons. Now 27 years old and extremely overworked (1,938 career touches), Elliott should be viewed as a mid-to-back-end RB2.",

He's back for 2022 and positioned for a big workload with running mate James Robinson recovering from a torn Achilles. Etienne was arguably the most explosive back in last year's class and also brings speed and strong pass-catching ability to the table. He racked up a massive 6,107 yards and 78 TDs on 788 touches at Clemson, which included 85 receptions over his final two seasons. Etienne's elusiveness jumps off the page, as his 4.1 YAC ranked third and his 3.3 forced missed tackle rate sixth in the 2021 class. Etienne's output may eventually be limited by Robinson, but he has a path to, at least, RB2 production out of the gate.",

The 26-year-old has ranked no lower than eighth in pass attempts, completions, yards and TDs each of the last two seasons, but it's his legs that give him such a huge edge in fantasy. Allen has ranked no lower than fourth in carries and rushing TDs among QBs in his career and ran for a career-high 763 yards in 2021. Allen's rate stats plummeted last season (63% completions, 6.8 YPA), but his heavy pass volume, aggressive nature (top 10 in average depth of throw all four seasons) and high-end rushing output are more than enough to allow elite fantasy production. He's your top QB fantasy option.",

        "seasonOutlook": "Brown was traded to Arizona after three seasons in Baltimore. The 2019 first-round pick has emerged as one of the league's best (and most underrated) high-volume, vertical targets over the last two seasons. Brown has finished top 12 among wideouts in target share and top five in average depth of route each of the past two seasons. He posted a career-best 22nd-place fantasy finish in 2021, but that's a bit misleading. Brown was 11th in fantasy PPG in 11 games with Lamar Jackson, but 67th in five games while Jackson was out. Brown now joins a more crowded Arizona offense, but especially with DeAndre Hopkins suspended for six games, he remains positioned for a sizable workload in a Kyler Murray-led offense. Brown's value took a hit, but he remains a fantasy WR3.",

Metcalf's 2020 included a combination of high-end volume and efficiency, which led to an 83-1,303-10 receiving line and seventh-place fantasy finish (10th in PPG). Last season, the volume remained, but efficiency plummeted (Russell Wilson missing time didn't help) and Metcalf ended up 13th in fantasy (23rd in PPG) with a 75-967-12 line. He has a lot going for him -- he's 24 years old, perhaps the most physically intimidating WR in the league and oft-targeted deep downfield and near the goal line (top five in end zone targets in all three NFL seasons). However, Seattle has major QB issues with Russell Wilson out and Drew Lock in, which will hurt Metcalf in the scoring and efficiency departments. He's still in the WR2 mix, but riskier than in past years.",

        "seasonOutlook": "Jeudy was the 15th overall pick in the 2020 draft, so a lack of a top-40 fantasy campaign through two seasons is an obvious disappointment. Of course, there are two major reasons for optimism heading into 2022: 1.) he's still extremely young at age 23. And 2.) Denver's QB situation went from poor to great after the trade for Russell Wilson. Jeudy has already seen a decent target share (21%), but has an ugly 54% catch rate and only three touchdowns on 167 targets, including zero on 55 targets in 2021. We can anticipate much better efficiency and a big boost in scoring in 2022. Wilson led both DK Metcalf and Tyler Lockett to fantasy stardom in Seattle and is a good bet to do the same for the super-talented Jeudy, who is safest as a WR3, but possesses elite upside.",

Sutton has already flashed his upside (he had a 72-1,112-6 receiving line and was a top-20 fantasy WR in 2019) and he's been utilized as both a deep threat (15.0 aDOT ranked third at WR in 2021) and goal-line target (sixth in the NFL with 23 end zone targets during his first two seasons). The 26-year-old joins Jerry Jeudy as Wilson's top two targets and Wilson supported two star fantasy WRs in Seattle (DK Metcalf and Tyler Lockett). Sutton is safest as a WR3, but no doubt has upside for more.",

Granted the elite efficiency came on relatively low volume in Baltimore's committee attack (134 carries), but the second-round pick's production increased down the stretch. Dobbins averaged 7.4 fantasy PPG during his first nine NFL games before posting 13-plus points in six consecutive games to finish the season (17.0 per game). Gus Edwards will remain involved as a rusher and Dobbins may struggle for targets in Greg Roman's scheme (Baltimore is dead last in RB targets over the last four seasons), but Dobbins' elite athleticism and role in Baltimore's high-scoring offense is enough to allow RB2 production.",

        "seasonOutlook": "Detroit selected St. Brown in the fourth round of the 2021 draft and, after a very slow start, the USC product exploded down the stretch. St. Brown posted a 39-352-0 receiving line on 4.7 targets per game during his first 11 games, but followed with no fewer than 10 targets, eight catches or 73 yards in each of his final six games. He scored five TDs and was fantasy's No. 2 WR during the span. St. Brown's late-season tear puts him in some elite company and suggests Detroit has found itself a star. Sure, he'll have more competition moving forward (Jameson Williams and DJ Chark Jr. were added and both D'Andre Swift and T.J. Hockenson were hurt most of late last season), but St. Brown still has a clear path to a generous target share (and a few carries). He's on the WR2 radar.",

The 2020 fifth-round pick developed into a featured target, handling 27% of the team's targets (10th highest among WRs). Mooney finished top 20 at the position in snaps, routes, targets, receptions and yards, though Chicago's offensive struggles limited him to only four touchdowns and, in turn, a 23rd-place finish in fantasy. Chicago is in the midst of a rebuild, but there is at least potential for a big offensive improvement if second-year QB Justin Fields makes a leap. Mooney has extremely little competition for targets and should remain one of the league's busiest wide receivers. He's a good WR3 with WR2 upside.",
