              "seasonOutlook": "Sanders signed with the Panthers following four seasons with the Eagles. The 2019 second-round pick has been nothing short of elite as a rusher since he was drafted (career 5.02 YPC), but he's been limited by major struggles in the passing game (his 3.8 YPT ranks last among RBs since 2020). That was on full display in 2022, when he ranked fifth in the league in rushing yards but 73rd among RBs in receiving yards. Sanders' 15th-place fantasy finish matched a career high, but the receiving struggles limited him to a 54% snaps share and eight single-digit fantasy outings. Carolina has a rookie QB and the offensive line is a big step back from what Sanders enjoyed in Philly, but the 26-year-old will handle the bulk of the carries and likely goal line work. That will be enough to keep him in the RB2 discussion, especially in non-PPR formats.",

He's missed at least two games every season, which includes four in 2022. Durability aside, Conner has been great. He finished 2022 with eight consecutive top-20 fantasy weeks (most of which came with Kyler Murray sidelined) and he's been top 10 in fantasy PPG each of the past two seasons. Conner's durability woes knock him down a few pegs, but the 28-year-old played 85% of the snaps down the stretch last season and has little competition for the feature back role in 2023. Consider him a back-end RB2.",

The 2022 second-round pick took over as the team's lead back in Week 6 last season and went on to handle 80% of the team's carries (19.7 per game) and 8% of the targets (2.5 per game) during 11 full games. Walker was fantasy's No. 8 RB in points per game (17.1) during 10 regular-season weeks atop the depth chart, though his 21-151-0 receiving line during the span exacerbates the concerns raised prior to last year's draft related to his lack of passing-game involvement. The 22-year-old looks the part as a rusher, but especially with second-round rookie Zach Charbonnet now in the mix, Walker could max out at Nick Chubb-like usage, which would limit his ceiling. He's safest as a midrange RB2.",

Mattison's overall efficiency doesn't leap off the page (career 4.13 YPC, 1.91 YAC), but his production when Cook missed time can't be ignored. Cook was sidelined for four games in 2021 and Mattison proceeded to lead the NFL in touches (105), rushing yards (518) and fantasy points in his stead. Mattison has yet to clear 166 touches in a single season, so we don't want to get too carried away, but the 25 year old is well positioned as the lead back in one of the league's top-scoring offenses. He's safest as your second RB but he certainly has top 10 upside.",

The culprits were a big drop in pass TDs (from 38 to 25) and rushing output (from 302 yards and three TDs to 147 yards and zero TDs). The latter (or perhaps both) may have been related to rib and labrum injuries, so a rebound in 2023 is certainly a possibility. That's especially the case with a new playcaller in Kellen Moore and with a good supporting cast led by Keenan Allen, Mike Williams and Austin Ekeler. Herbert, who ranked fifth with eight top-10 fantasy outings last season, remains a solid fantasy starter with upside.",

Fields was unsurprisingly a major factor as a rusher, as he led all QBs in rushing yards (1,143), yards per carry (7.1) and scrambles (67) to go along with eight rush TDs. Fields is still on the ascent at age 24 and his supporting cast will be much better this season with DJ Moore joining Chase Claypool, Darnell Mooney and Cole Kmet. Fields' legs make him a solid QB1 target, but he's a candidate for a full-on breakout.",

The 26-year-old has handled a target share of at least 24% and has finished as a top-25 fantasy WR each of the last four seasons. Moore figures to maintain a generous target share in Chicago, but he's moving to an offense that ranked 31st in WR targets, 30th in snaps and was second run-heaviest in the league last season. Those numbers figure to improve a bit, but perhaps not a ton with Justin Fields (who ranked first in scrambles last season) under center. Moore, who has cleared four TDs once in his career, is best viewed as a WR3.",

              "seasonOutlook": "Evans has finished all nine of his NFL seasons as a top-25 fantasy WR, but that streak seems to be in doubt as he enters his age-30 season with major QB uncertainty. Despite Tom Brady setting the single-season completion record last season, Evans finished 21st among WRs in receptions and 17th in fantasy points. The latter is a bit misleading, as he finished outside the top 30 in 60% of his games but was bailed out by a late-season 207-yard, three-TD game (48.7 fantasy points). Evans saw a career-low 10 end zone targets and was limited to six TDs after totaling 27 during Brady's first two seasons. With Brady retired and Baker Mayfield and/or Kyle Trask under center, Evans' upside appears limited. The vertical target is best valued as a WR3.",

In 15 full games in 2021, Williams posted a 74-1119-9 receiving line (21% share) and was 14th in fantasy PPG (16.1). \"When healthy\" shouldn't be glossed over, however, as Williams has missed six games over the last three seasons and left six others early. We can't count on 17 healthy games, but the 28-year-old is a featured perimeter target in a good offense, so he'll remain a viable WR3 is long as Justin Herbert is under center.",

He has primarily operated as a vertical threat (12th in aDOT each of the last two seasons) and has struggled to find the end zone (13 TDs over the last three seasons). McLaurin is a good player (his 9.9 YPT ranked sixth last season), but he can't seem to get over the top and into the WR1 mix. That may not change this season with Jahan Dotson's role likely to increase and with Jacoby Brissett and/or Sam Howell under center. McLaurin is safest as a fringe WR2.",

Granted, the sample was small (110 touches) but Cook impressed as a rookie, averaging 5.7 yards per carry (third highest among RBs) and 8.6 yards per reception. The 2022 second-round pick is a potential breakout candidate, especially in an elite Bills offense, though his ceiling may prove a bit limited if he defers some work to Damien Harris and Latavius Murray in a scheme that doesn't use RBs much in the passing game. The 23-year-old cleared 12 touches in one game as a rookie and is best viewed as a RB2 target.",

              "seasonOutlook": "Williams appeared to be on the verge of a breakout last season, but a Week 4 torn ACL derailed his campaign. The 2021 second-round pick accrued 60-plus scrimmage yards in three consecutive games to open the season and was third among RBs in targets (21) during the span. This after he impressed with 1,219 yards and seven TDs in a timeshare with Melvin Gordon as a rookie in 2021. Williams is still only 23 years old and his future appears bright (especially if he slides into an Alvin Kamara-like role under new coach Sean Payton), but it's possible he'll miss time and see a dip in short-term effectiveness as he gets back to full health. We'll need to monitor Williams' recovery this summer, but he'll nonetheless be a very risky early-round fantasy investment.",

After playing a shockingly minor early-season role, Akers was away from the team for a month before returning and eventually taking over the feature back role. In fact, from Week 13 on, Akers played 73% of the Rams' offensive snaps, handling 70% of the carries (17.3 per game) and 8% of the targets (2.0) during the span. He ranked fifth among RBs in fantasy points during the six-week span. Akers is still early in his prime at age 24 and he's perhaps now back to full health after tearing his Achilles in 2021. He remains positioned atop the Rams' depth chart with minimal competition, so while last season's drama (not to mention an underwhelming receiving role) adds risk, Akers has a path to RB2 production with upside for more.",

Waller's 2019 breakout led to back-to-back top-three fantasy campaigns, but injuries derailed his output the past two seasons. He missed 14 games during the span, but was still fairly effective when on the field, ranking top 10 in fantasy PPG both seasons. Even with the injuries, Waller has seen eight-plus end zone targets in three straight seasons. The 31-year-old is joining a New York offense that has an NFL-low 44 pass TDs over the past three seasons (17 in 2022), but he very well could lead the team in targets considering the question marks at wide receiver. Waller is primed for a rebound and is a top-five fantasy tight end.",

The 2020 first-round pick set career highs in receptions, yardage, TDs and end zone targets (nine) en route to a 22nd-place fantasy finish. He finished the season with five straight top-30 outings. Jeudy struggled with inefficiency as a rookie and went without a single TD in 2021, but he got both on track last season, including eighth-place finishes in YPT (9.7) and RAC (5.8). The 24-year-old has taken control as Denver's No. 1 WR and very well could make another leap this season with Sean Payton calling the offense. Consider him a WR3 with upside.",

              "seasonOutlook": "Brown was traded to the Cardinals last offseason and the ex-Raven handled a hefty 9.0 targets (24% share) during the 12 games he was on the field. That includes 10.8 per game (27% share) and 18.3 fantasy PPG (seventh highest) during Weeks 1-6 -- the only six games he played with Kyler Murray and without DeAndre Hopkins. Brown struggled without Murray down the stretch (and may need to overcome his absence early on in 2023 as his QB rehabs a torn ACL), but the good news is that his volume remained good even with his QB sidelined (35 targets in five games). The 26-year-old might start slow, but he's a candidate for weekly WR2/3 production.",

If you took the discount, congrats on the steal. Lockett had one of the highest floors in fantasy, posting a top-30 point total in 13 of 16 games. He finished the season as a top-16 fantasy WR for the fifth consecutive season and -- believe it or not -- he's the only player in the league with at least eight TDs each of the past five seasons. Lockett is now 30 years old, but he's been durable (exactly 16 games played in six straight seasons) and his play didn't slip last season. The arrival of Jaxon Smith-Njigba could reduce his targets slightly, but Lockett remains in the WR3 mix.",

London has the look of a good (perhaps great) player, but he was limited by an Atlanta offense that ranked 31st in pass attempts, and it's unlikely the volume will change much with Arthur Smith calling the plays, unproven Desmond Ridder under center and Bijan Robinson now in the backfield.

San Francisco's top perimeter receiver set career-high marks in targets, receptions, yardage and TDs en route to a 15th-place finish in fantasy points (24th in PPG). Aiyuk's production was a bit volatile and he got very lucky in the TD department (his three end zone targes ranked 82nd at WR), but a 23% target share in a Kyle Shanahan offense is nothing to sneeze at. The 49ers' QB situation is uncertain and Aiyuk has substantial target competition in Deebo Samuel, Christian McCaffrey and George Kittle, but the 25-year-old former first-round pick will see enough work to deliver WR3/flex numbers.",

He finished second in 2022, but got quite lucky in the TD department (his TE-high 12.8% TD rate was three times his prior career rate), which overshadowed a concerning 16% target share (4.2 per game) and 10.2 fantasy PPG (would've ranked eighth over the full season) during nine full games with Christian McCaffrey, Deebo Samuel and Brandon Aiyuk. Kittle has some durability concerns, having completed one full regular season (2018) in six tries. He remains a fine TE1 option, but with more target competition than ever before, it's possible the 29-year-old settles in as more of a midrange starter than the top-end play he's been in recent years.",

Pitts was hyped up for obvious reasons -- he went for 1,026 yards and was fantasy's No. 6 TE as a 20-year-old rookie -- but the Florida product's season was derailed by Atlanta's run-heavy scheme and a seven-game injury absence. In 10 games, Pitts was limited to two weekly fantasy finishes better than 12th. On the plus side, Pitts' 27% target share trailed only Mark Andrews among TEs and he's now led the position in aDOT in both seasons. Atlanta will continue to run the ball plenty, but Pitts is still only 22 years old and remains without much competition for targets. He's an excellent post-hype target with massive upside.",

The 2018 second-round pick has been super-efficient, pacing the position in yards per target each of the past two seasons and ranking top five in RAC both years. On the other hand, Goedert has been limited by a lack of goal line work (he's never cleared five TDs in a season and has exactly two end zone targets each of the past two seasons) and shaky durability (his last full season was 2018 and he's missed 13 games over the past four seasons). The 28-year-old will maintain a substantial role in the high-scoring Eagles offense (only A.J. Brown and DeVonta Smith are ahead of him for targets) and he is a solid TE1 target.",

The former Texan was suspended for 11 games last season and struggled upon his return, ranking 22nd in fantasy points per game. On the plus side, he finished strong with his only two top-eight weekly finishes and he was his usual productive self with his legs (fourth at QB in rushing yards during six active weeks). Watson, who was a top-five fantasy QB in three straight seasons prior to missing 2021, is a good bet to improve in his second season with the Browns. He'll be working behind a good offensive line and has a solid group of targets led by Amari Cooper and David Njoku. It's safest to view Watson as a fringe QB1, but he has elite upside.",

The 23-year-old's best days are likely ahead of him and, while the offensive line is a concern, a good group of targets led by Christian Kirk, Travis Etienne and Evan Engram will be even better with Calvin Ridley in the mix. Lawrence is a midrange QB1 with upside for more.",

During four seasons in Chicago, Montgomery never finished a season lower than 20th in touches, 21st in yards or 24th in fantasy points among RBs. Even with Gibbs in the mix, he has a good chance to keep that streak going, especially in a fantasy-friendly role that allowed Williams a league-high 17 TDs and 28 carries inside the opponent's 5-yard line last season. Montgomery (14th among RBs in targets since 2019) is a more accomplished receiver than Williams, so there's a lot to like in a Detroit offense that led the NFL with 501 RB fantasy points in 2022. Target Montgomery as a flex option.",

Dobbins is a great rusher (career 5.7 YPC), but injuries have limited him to 23 games in three seasons and he's yet to make an impact as a receiver (32 career targets). Perhaps Baltimore will find a way to get Dobbins more involved in the passing game, but running back targets have been few and far between in Baltimore's offense over the past decade, so that's far from certain. The 24-year-old is an interesting post-hype breakout candidate, but he'll need more of a receiving role in order to be anything more than a low-ceiling RB2/flex.",

              "seasonOutlook": "Cook signed with the Jets in August after he was released by the Vikings in early June. He's been a top fantasy back since he was drafted in 2017, so it may surprise you to know that 2022 marked his first season appearing in 100% of Minnesota's regular-season games. Cook ranked sixth among RBs in carries and rushing yards, and has finished top 10 in both categories (as well as touches and scrimmage yards) each of the past four seasons. He also saw 56 targets (15th most), which were his most since 2019. Cook's fantasy output has started to slip a bit (he was 15th in fantasy PPG in 2022 after an 11th-place showing in 2021) and he's unlikely to return to the RB1 mix as long as Breece Hall is a factor. Hall is recovering from a torn ACL, so Cook may start 2022 strong, but as Hall's role increases, the 28-year-old will be reduced to flex value (at best).",

The 2018 second-round pick posted modest numbers during four seasons in Arizona but was a featured target in Jacksonville and ended up no lower than 15th among WRs in targets, receptions, yards, TDs and fantasy points. The 26-year-old will remain a featured target in a Jaguars offense on the ascent, but the arrival of Calvin Ridley figures to reduce his volume a bit. Kirk had never produced a top-25 fantasy campaign prior to 2022 and, especially with Ridley, Zay Jones, Evan Engram and Travis Etienne in the mix this season, he's safest viewed as a high-floor WR3 in 2023.",

Pittman ranked top 10 at wide receiver in snaps, routes and targets, but his 7.3 aDOT, 9.3 YPR and 6.5 YPT all ranked near the basement. He managed only two top-12 fantasy weeks and both were prior to Week 7. Pittman was, of course, dealing with the Colts' massive QB woes and while his downfield looks figure to increase with rookie Anthony Richardson under center in 2023, his target volume may decrease in what projects as a run-heavy scheme. Pittman has produced consecutive top-20 fantasy campaigns but is safest as a WR3 in 2023.",

The 2022 second-round pick finished 17th at the position in routes but only 48th in targets. Pickens' volume was limited by a vertical-heavy role (his 14.7 aDOT ranked third), but his efficiency was solid (9.5 YPT ranked 11th). Pickens' target volume inexplicably barely changed when Chase Claypool was traded last season (he never cleared six targets in a game after that point), but it figures to increase in his second NFL season. The 22-year-old's downfield role makes him more valuable in non-PPR, but especially if second-year QB Kenny Pickett makes a leap, Pickens has a shot at flex value (or better) in all formats.",

The 2014 first-round pick has finished 23rd or better in fantasy PPG in seven of his nine seasons, though the most recent was a 37th-place showing in 2022. Cooks had to deal with weak QB play in Houston, but he has also dealt with injuries (his last full season was in 2018) and has struggled to find the end zone (he last cleared six TDs in a season in 2017). The 29-year-old could settle in as high as second in target priority behind only CeeDee Lamb in a good Dallas offense, which would be enough to place him on the weekly flex radar.",

Ignoring a 2020 season lost to injury, Sutton has finished one of four campaigns as a top-40 fantasy WR (2019). He has primarily been utilized as a vertical target (career 13.0 aDOT) and near the goal line (fifth among WRs with 13 end zone targets in 2022), but he can't seem to find the end zone (four TDs in 32 games over the past two seasons) and is a nonfactor after the catch (2.3 RAC is last among 35 players with 200-plus targets over the past two seasons). Perhaps Sean Payton's arrival will breathe life into Sutton's career, but we'll need to see it first, especially with Jerry Jeudy, rookie Marvin Mims and TE Greg Dulcich crowding the pass catching group. Tim Patrick's season-ending injury makes Sutton worthy of a mid-round flier.",

              "seasonOutlook": "Dotson is entering his second NFL season following an impressive, but fairly unheralded rookie campaign. The 2022 first-round pick missed five games due to injury but finished the year strong. He handled a target share of at least 21% in each of the team's final five games, which produced a 21-344-3 receiving line and 14.7 fantasy PPG (17th among WRs). And that came with Terry McLaurin averaging 15.5 PPG (13th-best) during the same span. Dotson's WR-high 11.3% TD rate isn't sustainable and his vertical role (14.4 aDOT ranked fourth) may lead to volatile production, but he's a good bet for a boost in volume in Year 2. He's a breakout candidate who you should be on your radar in the middle rounds.",

The Ohio State product broke out with a 95-1,606-9 receiving line (23% target share) in 2021, but injuries limited him to five catches in three games in 2022. His collegiate efficiency was excellent, as he posted one of the top marks in this rookie WR class in YPT (12.6), YPRR (3.40) and catch rate (81%) while working primarily in the short area (8.9 aDOT). Smith-Njigba is more quick than fast (he posted the best three-cone and short shuttle at April's combine) and will do his damage as a possession, slot receiver (81% slot at OSU). That makes him a perfect fit between DK Metcalf and Tyler Lockett in Seattle, though it will limit his short-term fantasy upside, not to mention that he may miss a week or two early in the season due to a hand injury. Stash him on your bench, as he'll be on the WR3/flex radar if one of those two misses time.",

The Western Michigan product was limited to 27% of the snaps and averaged 2.1 targets per game. Moore was extremely busy and effective during his college days, handling a massive 30% target share and dropping only four of 256 targets in 30 games. The 22-year-old is an obvious Year 2 breakout candidate in an elite, pass-heavy Kansas City offense with a wide open WR depth chart led by Marquez Valdes-Scantling, Kadarius Toney and rookie Rashee Rice.

              "seasonOutlook": "Herbert is entering his third NFL season in position for a larger role following Chicago's decision to replace longtime starter David Montgomery with journeymen D'Onta Foreman and Travis Homer, and fourth-round rookie Roschon Johnson. Herbert started his ascent at Montgomery's expense last season (his 5.67 YPC ranked fourth and his 2.33 YAC ninth among RBs), but was still limited to 138 touches in 13 games. Herbert has impressed as a rusher, but he hasn't been called on much in the passing game (12 targets in 2022). That's notable considering the 233-pound Foreman will be a big factor as a rusher and near the goal line. An expanded receiving role could vault Herbert into the RB2 mix, but if not he's likely to settle in as an underwhelming flex option.",

Dillon has proven reliable and durable, as he's one of only two fantasy-relevant backs who have appeared in all 34 regular-season games over the past two seasons. The 25-year-old finished in the 186-to-187 carry and 37-to-43 target range with exactly seven TDs each of the past two seasons. One of the league's biggest backs at 247 pounds, Dillon ranks 11th in the league with 20 carries inside the 5-yard line over the past two seasons. The Packers' offense figures to take a step back with Aaron Rodgers gone, so the 25-year-old will be an underwhelming flex option most weeks, though he'll vault into the RB1 discussion if 28-year-old Jones were to miss time.",

Swift is efficient on the ground (5.5 YPC ranked sixth in 2022) and finds the end zone (at least seven TDs in all three seasons), but a lot of his game is built on heavy work as a receiver (70 targets in 2022 ranked 10th at RB), which could be limited in an Eagles offense loaded with high-volume targets. The 24-year-old figures to operate in a committee but he's super-talented, so a return to weekly RB2 status is within his range of outcomes if he stays healthy.",

              "seasonOutlook": "Robinson is entering his second NFL season following a solid rookie campaign in which he piled up 214 touches in 12 games. It was an impressive comeback story after the third-round pick was shot in the leg just weeks prior to the season opener. Robinson is likely to split backfield duties with Antonio Gibson and we saw that dynamic in play for six full games last season. Robinson handled 50% of the carries (17.5 per game) and 5% of the targets (1.3), which allowed 11.9 fantasy PPG (24th among RBs). Robinson (6-2, 225 pounds) is one of the league's biggest backs and will be busy on early downs and at the goal line, but he's unlikely to be much of a factor as a receiver. As long as Gibson is in the mix, Robinson figures to max out as a flex option.",

In six full games together without J.D. McKissic, Gibson was limited to 31% of the carries (11.0 per game), but handled a hefty 14% of the targets (3.8). He wasn't much of a fantasy factor (9.3 PPG), but he'll find himself on the PPR flex radar in deeper leagues if he maintains the change-of-pace rushing role while handling most of Washington's passing-down work. The 25-year-old has a low ceiling as long as Robinson is in the mix, but he's a fine bench option.",

The 2021 second-round pick produced nine top-12 fantasy weeks (third most) and ranked sixth at the position in receptions and yardage. Freiermuth was a solid TE1 option despite finding the end zone only twice (3.8 expected) and some regression to the mean in 2023 could boost his fantasy output even further. The 24-year-old is behind only Diontae Johnson and perhaps George Pickens for targets, so especially with QB Kenny Pickett likely to take a step forward, Freiermuth is well positioned for another top-10 fantasy campaign.",

The 2017 first-round pick was top five at the position in snaps, routes, targets, receptions and receiving yards, but was limited to four TDs -- his most since he scored six as a rookie. Engram did run a bit cold at times, as 48.5% of his 177 fantasy points were scored in a four-game stretch (Weeks 13-16). He was fantasy's No. 1 TE in those weeks, but 25th (42-399-1 receiving line) in the other 13 weeks. The 29-year-old is a candidate for a slightly reduced role with Calvin Ridley now in the mix, but Engram was tagged for a reason and will sustain a solid target share in an ascending Jaguars offense. He's a back-end TE1.",

Njoku averaged 10.6 fantasy PPG in 13 full games (seventh among TEs) and finished the season no lower than 11th at the position in targets, receptions, yards, TDs and fantasy points. Two top concerns here are shaky durability (his only full season came in 2018 and he's missed three-plus games three of the past four seasons) and a lack of TDs (he's never cleared four in a season). Njoku was 17th among TEs in fantasy points during five full games with Deshaun Watson, but he did score twice and handled a hefty 21% target share. Njoku could finish as high as second on this team in targets and, with Watson entering his first full season in Cleveland, the 27-year-old tight end is a fine, back-end TE1 option.",

Kmet then scored six TDs in his final nine games and his 12.4 fantasy PPG during the span ranked fourth among tight ends. The 2020 second-round pick is a full-time player (no TE has played more snaps over the past two seasons), but he was way over his head in the TD department (seven TDs, 3.0 expected) and his already-inconsistent targets could dip after Chicago added DJ Moore to the WR room. Of course, Kmet is an ascending player at age 24, so there's reason for optimism that he can provide fringe TE1 numbers.",

Addison's 29 career TDs (35 games) were second most in this rookie WR class and he cleaned up early-career drop woes in 2022. He underwhelmed athletically at the combine, which included a 4.49 40-yard dash at 173 pounds (85 speed score, third lowest among 50 WRs in this class), but he landed in a great spot as Justin Jefferson's running mate in a Vikings offense that ranks fifth in TDs over the past three seasons. Addison should play a ton out of the gate and is well worth a mid-to-late-round flier.",

On the plus side, Tennessee manufactured touches for him (47 yards on four carries) and he was terrific with the ball in his hands (5.3 RAC ranked 12th at WR). The 23-year-old will operate as the Titans' No. 2 wideout opposite DeAndre Hopkins and his production will be limited by Tennessee's run-heavy scheme. However, he's a first-round talent with potential for a Year 2 breakout. He's on the flex radar.",

Thomas looked pretty good out of the gate last season (16-171-3 receiving line on 22 targets) and was fantasy's No. 16-scoring WR prior to suffering a season-ending injury after only three games. The strong play wasn't a huge shock for a player who set the NFL single-season receptions record in 2019, but another lost season is tough to swallow -- and he's now 30 years old. Perhaps Derek Carr's arrival will lead Thomas to a big rebound campaign, but it will be hard to count on him for a full season of high-end fantasy play. He's only worth a flier in the mid-to-late rounds.",

Undrafted in 2019, Meyers progressively worked his way up the New England depth chart and has handled a respectable 22%-plus target share each of the last three seasons. Meyers has finished each of the last two seasons exactly 29th in fantasy points despite major deficiencies in the TD department. The slot man has never cleared four end zone targets in a season and his six TD receptions in 2022 tripled his total during his first three campaigns (two). The 26-year-old will work behind Davante Adams in Las Vegas, but there's a path to a respectable target share with conservative Jimmy Garoppolo under center. Meyers has the look of a flex option in PPR formats.",

The veteran receiver ended up a respectable 27th in fantasy points last season, but his usage and production were extremely volatile (nine weeks with single-digit fantasy points). On the plus side, his 76% catch rate ranked fourth at wide receiver and he was his usual productive self with the ball in his hands (5.8 RAC ranked seventh). The 26-year-old, who has a pair of top-20 fantasy campaigns on his resume, has a good shot to lead the Patriots' new-look, Bill O'Brien-led offense in targets this season. Smith-Schuster is a flex option with upside for more if QB Mac Jones gets back on track.",
