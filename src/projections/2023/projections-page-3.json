The 2014 first-round pick has shown up with spurts of greatness over the years, but injuries have derailed his career. Beckham has played two full seasons since entering the league and has appeared in 53 of 98 possible games (54%) over the last six seasons. He was 30th in fantasy PPG during seven full games with the Rams when we last saw him in 2021, and he's now entering his age-31 season in a low-volume Baltimore pass offense. Beckham is going to be a featured target and that will land him on the weekly WR3/flex radar (at worst), but counting on him for a full season is extremely risky. He's only worth a mid-to-late round flier.",

Prescott managed only two weekly finishes better than eighth and finished 15th or worse in six of his 12 outings. The Dallas offense will have a new playcaller in Mike McCarthy, but the head coach has expressed a desire to slow down the offense and run more. That doesn't bode well for Prescott's upside, especially since the 30-year-old no longer offers much with his legs (48-146-1 and 45-182-1 rushing lines the last two seasons). Prescott does, however, have an excellent supporting cast (led by CeeDee Lamb, Brandin Cooks, Tony Pollard and an elite line), so he still has the look of a fringe QB1.",

Cousins finished last season no lower than fifth in pass attempts, yards and TDs, and -- believe it or not -- Minnesota ranks sixth in the NFL in offensive TDs since he arrived in 2018. The drawback with Cousins is that he's a nonfactor with his legs. He posted a 31-97-2 rushing line last season and hasn't cleared 156 yards or two TDs on the ground since 2017. Cousins has proven to be a good QB2 and bye-week replacement, but even with Justin Jefferson and T.J. Hockenson as his top targets, he simply lacks the upside you want in your weekly starter.",

The 2019 No. 6 pick took a leap forward last season, though his ninth-place finish in fantasy points was primarily fueled by a 120-708-7 rushing line (he ranked no lower than fifth at QB in carries, rush yards and rush TDs). Jones was held to 15 pass TDs in 16 games last season and that marks his most since he tossed 24 as a rookie in 2019. The Giants added Darren Waller and Parris Campbell (among others) during the offseason, which should help Jones' passing numbers, but there are major durability concerns with nearly all of this offense's top players (including Jones, who has missed 11 games due to injury). Jones' rushing and improved pass-catchers are enough to make him a fringe QB1.",

Tagovailoa's 8.9 YPA led the league, he trailed only Patrick Mahomes and Josh Allen in QBR and he was seventh in fantasy PPG during the 12 weeks he played more than half the snaps. A healthy Tagovailoa has immense fantasy upside in a pass-heavy Miami scheme with Tyreek Hill and Jaylen Waddle locked in at wide receiver, but we have to worry a bit about durability, as well as his minimal contributions as a rusher (24-70-0 rushing line in 2022). Tagovailoa is a fringe QB1 option.",

              "seasonOutlook": "Flowers was selected in the first round of April's draft. The Boston College product is on the small side (5-foot-9, 182 lbs.), but was heavily targeted during his 48 games at BC, managing a target share of at least 28% in each of his final three seasons. His efficiency was solid despite a horrific 68% catchable ball rate (second lowest in this rookie WR class) and he also contributed as a rusher (57-345-2) and punt returner. He can align all over the formation and has 4.42 wheels. Flowers has a path to immediate big-time snaps opposite Odell Beckham Jr., but fantasy output may be sporadic in this explosive, but low-volume passing game. Flowers is best as a late-round flier and bench stash.",

The TCU product is a big, athletic and fast receiver who had some struggles with drops, but was heavily targeted (24% share) and terrific after the catch (career 8.4 RAC was best in this year's rookie WR class) in 32 collegiate games. He posted one of the biggest wingspans, verticals and broad jumps at April's combine, which just added to his appeal/upside as a vertical, boundary (87% perimeter at TCU) receiver. Johnston will begin his career behind Keenan Allen and Mike Williams, but this offense has big upside with Justin Herbert under center. Target Johnston with a late-round pick, as he'll be a WR3/flex option if Williams or Allen misses time.",

As expected, Davis was promoted into an every-down role opposite Stefon Diggs, but he was pigeonholed into a situational deep-threat role (his 15.4 aDOT and 17.4 YPR both ranked second in the league), which led to a weak 6.2 targets per game and a horrific 52% catch rate. Davis also led the league with nine drops and has yet to reach 50 catches or eight TDs in a season. The latter is a bit surprising considering he has 35 end zone targets (sixth-most among all players) since he was drafted in 2020. The 24-year-old's role will allow the occasional big game but also a ton of duds, and his 2022 output has serious Marquez Valdes-Scantling vibes. There's some post-hype sleeper appeal here, but Davis is worth no more than a bench spot.",

The versatile slot receiver handled 72 touches in 14 games as a rookie but was limited to 47 touches in eight games last season. Moore was featured at times (eight-plus targets in five games) and sat 30th at WR in fantasy PPG during the seven weeks he played in full. He is severely limited by a short-range role (career 3.2 aDOT), which helps his catch rate (79%) and RAC (7.6) but crushes his yardage (8.9 YPR) and scoring opportunities (three end zone targets). The 23-year-old's tiny frame (5-foot-7, 181 lbs.) is going to cap his ceiling and the Arizona offense may struggle with Kyler Murray likely to miss time rehabbing a torn ACL, but he's positioned for heavy usage with only Marquise Brown ahead on the depth chart. Moore is a sneaky late-round flier.",

              "seasonOutlook": "Williams signed with the Saints following a breakout 2022 season in which he led the NFL with 17 rushing touchdowns. The veteran back easily set career highs across the board as a rusher, including an absurd 28 carries inside the opponent's 5-yard line (no other player had more than 20). On the flip side, Williams was a nonfactor as a receiver (73 yards on 16 targets), which led to extremely inconsistent fantasy output. Now 28 years old, Williams is expected to work as an early-down and short-yardage complement to Alvin Kamara. Of course, with Kamara set to serve a three-game suspension, Williams will open the season in more of a featured role, with Kendre Miller also involved. Williams is well worth mid-round consideration, though he's unlikely to be a starting option once Kamara returns in Week 4.",

The duo played five full games together in 2022, with Wilson handling 50 carries (48% team share) and 16 targets (11%). That's respectable usage, but it resulted in only 48 fantasy points (9.5 per game). The 27-year-old has proven to be an effective rusher (4.89 YPC last season) but is limited by a lack of production in the passing game (57 catches in 53 career games). A good Miami offense will help his TD opportunities, but we should expect Wilson to settle in as a low-ceiling flex while working in a committee that could also include speedy rookie Devon Achane.",

The 2017 fourth-round pick put together his best fantasy campaign last season (681 yards and six TDs on 133 touches) and showed some lead back potential, producing 330 yards and four TDs on 63 touches during three games Joe Mixon was injured. Perine has been a backup most of his career (401 carries, 122 targets) and that will be his role in Denver, but it's possible he'll be called on for a larger workload early in the season as Javonte Williams (torn ACL last season) gets back to full speed. Perine, now 27 years old, will be on the RB2 radar only if Williams is sidelined.",

The 2018 first-round pick is an elite rusher -- his career 5.69 YPC is tops in the NFL since he was drafted -- but the problem is injuries have limited him to 337 carries in five seasons. Penny has missed at least six games in four consecutive seasons and was healthy for only five games in 2022. He's also failed to emerge as an option in the passing game, having yet to clear nine catches in a single season. Sanders finished eighth in carries and 44th in targets among RBs last season and while Penny could see similar usage, he's going to defer plenty of work (especially in passing situations) to D'Andre Swift and perhaps Kenneth Gainwell. Penny is safest as a flex option with added value in non-PPR.",

He hasn't been much of a factor in the run game for quite a while (165 carries in those 46 games), but he delivered in a big way as a receiver in 2022 (56-512-9). In fact, McKinnon is now one of seven RBs in NFL history to catch at least nine TDs in a single season. Despite the 10-TD campaign, McKinnon's situational role limited him to 27th in fantasy PPG and he's yet to finish a season better than 24th. Now 31 years old, McKinnon will remain a change-of-pace/receiving back alongside Isiah Pacheco and perhaps Clyde Edwards-Helaire. McKinnon lacks upside, but has some late-round appeal in PPR.",

The 2018 fourth-round pick has finished each of the past three seasons no lower than 11th among tight ends in targets, receptions, yards and fantasy points. The veteran tight end certainly benefited from Dallas' fast-paced, high-scoring offense, so it's fair to wonder if he'll take a step back in a Houston offense with a rookie QB (C.J. Stroud). On the other hand, Houston's WR room leaves something to be desired, so Schultz's target share shouldn't change much from years past. There's some risk here as he joins a new team, but Schultz is safe to value as a fringe TE1.",

Prior to the injury, Ertz was his usual productive self, averaging 12.6 fantasy PPG (fifth highest) and trailing only Travis Kelce in receptions at the tight end position. Ertz is averaging a generous 20% target sure in 20 games since joining Arizona and he's finished top 10 in fantasy PPG six of the past seven seasons. QB Kyler Murray (also rehabbing an ACL) will be out for a while, but 32-year-old Ertz's impressive recovery and big-time usage suggest he'll remain on the TE1 radar in 2023. Consider him with a late pick.",

The 2018 second-round pick enjoyed his big breakout back in 2019 (73-1008-8 receiving line), but he hasn't been able to repeat that success since. Durability has been a major roadblock, as he has missed 28 of a possible 82 regular-season games (24.6%). That includes six during a 2022 season in Detroit in which he led the NFL with a 15.6 aDOT but was limited to only 52 targets in 11 games. The good news is that Chark could settle in as high as first in line for targets in a new-look Carolina offense led by coach Frank Reich and first-overall pick Bryce Young. Chark's durability is a concern, but he has a path to weekly flex value when on the field.",

After a solid showing as a rookie (61-631-4 receiving line), Mooney had his big breakout in 2021 (81-1055-4 and a 23rd-place finish in fantasy points). He maintained a substantial target share last season but missed five games and struggled for consistency in Chicago's run-heavy scheme. This offense is on the ascent, but Justin Fields' scramble ability is going to limit the passing game volume. Mooney has more competition for targets than ever before and the 25-year-old is worth no more than a late-round flier.",

              "seasonOutlook": "Collins is entering his third NFL season with an opportunity take control of Houston's No. 1 WR job following the offseason trade of Brandin Cooks. The 2021 third-round pick averaged a healthy 6.8 targets per game in nine full games last season, but he dealt with poor QB play (league-high 28% off target rate) and barely cracked the top 50 in fantasy PPG. Collins has missed 10 games in two seasons and has struggled to find the end zone (three career TDs), but he has shown good hands (one drop on 125 targets) and his 6-foot-4 frame figures to eventually lead to more goal line work. The 24-year-old is a fine target with your bench and could land on the flex radar if he gels well with rookie QB C.J. Stroud.",

The 2021 second-round pick flashed potential stardom for a stretch during his rookie season, soaking up 494 yards and five TDs on 38 touches during Weeks 8-13. His 18.9 fantasy PPG during the span was seventh best among wide receivers. A Week 13 quad injury ended Moore's season early and he never quite got on track in 2022, reportedly clashing with coaches along the way. Moore scored one TD, never cleared 64 yards or 14.0 fantasy points during 16 appearances and his 0.9 YPRR ranked dead last. Moore is a talented player, so while he's a bit of a lottery ticket, it's possible he'll break out with Deshaun Watson in Cleveland. For that reason, the 23-year-old is a viable late-round flier in deeper leagues.",

Gallup has missed 11 games over the last two seasons while recovering from a torn ACL, but he wasn't much of a factor when on the field anyway, ranking outside the top 45 in fantasy PPG both seasons (and in four of five NFL campaigns). The 27-year-old has never cleared six TDs in a season and struggled badly with efficiency in 2022, ranking 81st in catch rate (53%) and 85th in YPT (5.8) among 86 qualified WRs. Perhaps Gallup will rebound after a full offseason with a healthy ACL, but his upside is capped a bit with CeeDee Lamb and perhaps Brandin Cooks ahead of him for targets. Gallup is only worth consideration in the late rounds.",

That run resulted in three top-10 fantasy campaigns (and the fourth-most TDs among WRs over the last five seasons), but Thielen is now one of the league's oldest wide receivers at age 33 and his production has started to slip. He missed 11 games during the 2019-21 seasons and, though he did hold up for all 17 in 2022, he finished outside the Top 25 receivers in targets, receptions, yards and fantasy points. His 17% target share was his lowest since 2016. Thielen figures to start opposite DJ Chark and will be a solid, veteran presence for rookie QB Bryce Young, but he's well past his prime and figures to max out as a deep league flex option.",

The Florida product is a big (6'4\", 244 lbs.) and strong dual-threat QB who absolutely dominated at the combine, pacing this rookie QB class in the 40-yard dash (4.43), vertical (record-setting 40.5\") and broad jump (129\"). Richardson will make plays with his legs (145-1,221-12 rushing line at Florida, including a class-best 8.4 YPC) and via downfield throws (class-high 10.3 aDOT) but has major accuracy concerns (class-worst 55% completion rate, 3.8% INT rate and 15.5% off-target rate) and is raw (13 career starts). Richardson has massive upside and his legs may be enough to immediately get him on the fantasy QB1 radar even if he struggles as a passer. Consider him with a late-round pick on draft day.",

Rodgers is coming off easily the worst fantasy campaign of his career, having finished 25th in points per game after previously never finishing worse than 13th (and worse than ninth only once). Shockingly, Rodgers' best weekly finish was ninth in Week 10 and a whopping 32 QBs had more top-10 fantasy weeks. Granted, his supporting cast wasn't very good (29 dropped passes ranked third), but Rodgers threw 12 INTs (his most since 2008) and had a career-worst showing as a rusher (34-94-1). The 39-year-old has a respectable supporting cast in New York (led by top WR Garrett Wilson), but he's no longer an elite fantasy option and is safest as a fringe QB1.",

After attempting a total of 196 passes during the prior seven seasons, Smith led the NFL in completion percentage (70%), posted the seventh-best QBR (60.8) and tossed the fourth-most TDs (30). Also a difference-maker with his legs (eighth at QB with 366 rushing yards), Smith finished fifth among QBs in fantasy points -- the first finish better than 20th in his 10-year career. Smith's resume suggests a return to earth could be in order, but that's not a lock, especially since he'll still be throwing to one of the league's best WR duos in DK Metcalf and Tyler Lockett, as well as first-round rookie Jaxon Smith-Njigba. He's best viewed as a good QB2.",

              "seasonOutlook": "Wilson's first season with the Broncos can safely be filed under \"worst-case scenario\". The veteran QB missed two games due to injury and managed only 19 TDs in 15 games while taking a league-high 55 sacks. Wilson averaged a career-low 15.1 fantasy PPG and had one weekly outing better than 14th prior to a strong finish (three top-five weeks in his final four games). Wilson hasn't been a reliable fantasy starter the past two seasons, but there is some reason for optimism here with Sean Payton now running the Denver offense. The Broncos also upgraded their offensive line and have a good group of targets, led by Jerry Jeudy and Courtland Sutton. The 34-year-old Wilson is a fine mid-to-late-round flier.",

It was a rough landing spot for the UCLA product, as his best-case scenario may now be a committee attack along with Kenneth Walker III in Seattle. Charbonnet is a big back with solid speed and three-down ability who can be a plus as a rusher, receiver and blocker. After transferring from Michigan, he produced at least 225 touches, 1,300 yards and 13 TDs in both seasons at UCLA. He ended up with 39 TDs in 41 collegiate games, though his YAC and elusiveness numbers were more pedestrian than good. Charbonnet will have a role in Seattle, but with Walker taking on a large share of the carries, he's unlikely to provide consistent flex value. He's an elite insurance option, though, and should be stashed on benches.",

The 2019 third-round pick as reliable as they come, as he's the only fantasy-relevant back who has appeared in 100% of his team's regular-season games over the last three seasons. Singletary's rushing efficiency has been good (his career 4.69 YPC ranks eighth among 38 qualified RBs) and he has been a consistent contributor in the passing game (38-plus catches in three consecutive seasons). Singletary has yet to finish a season higher than 15th among RBs in carries, targets, touches or fantasy points, and that's unlikely to change as he plays second fiddle to second-year Dameon Pierce in Houston. The 26-year-old is best valued as a bench/insurance hold.",

Including the playoffs, the Louisiana product produced 1,326 yards and seven TDs on 288 touches in 14 games as a rookie before being limited to 73 touches in seven games in 2022. Mitchell played six full games with McCaffrey last season and was actually pretty busy as a rusher (62 carries to McCaffrey's 67). Of course, even if Mitchell stays healthy and splits carries with McCaffrey, his rushing ceiling will be limited and he'll be a nonfactor in the passing game. The 25-year-old is a good insurance option for your bench.",

Elliott has never finished a season with fewer than eight TDs, but his production and efficiency have plummeted in recent years. He hasn't finished top 15 in fantasy PPG since 2019, and that includes a career-worst 23rd-place showing in 2022. Elliott also posted career-low marks in rushing yards (876), YPC (3.79), YAC (1.66), targets (23), receptions (17), receiving yards (92) and yards per target (4.0) in 2022. The 28-year-old's best days are behind him and he's now likely to settle in as a complement to Rhamondre Stevenson. Elliott has some insurance appeal, but is unlikely to have weekly standalone value. Only consider him late in drafts.",

The 24-year-old has no standalone fantasy value, but he'd be on the RB2/flex radar in the event that Harris were to miss time (something he's yet to do through two seasons).

During his rookie season, Allgeier averaged 4.93 yards per carry and his 2.60 YAC was second best among qualified RBs. A lack of scoring (four TDs) and receiving (17 targets) limited the fifth-round rookie's fantasy output for most of the season, but he was promoted to a larger role down the stretch and finished with four consecutive fantasy outings in the top 16 among RBs. That tells us that the 224-pound back has some insurance appeal, but as long as Robinson is healthy, Allgeier will be limited to a handful of carries and perhaps the occasional target. Even in a run-heavy offense, he's worth no more than a late flier.",

Granted, there was some survivorship bias (he finished 14th on a per-game basis after he was 13th in 2021), but the tight end cleared 100 targets for the first time and ranked fifth among tight ends in receptions. On the negative side, Higbee led the position in drops (eight) and was held to three TDs (he's yet to clear five in a season). The 30-year-old may continue to see a healthy target share in an offense lacking standouts behind Cooper Kupp. He has settled in as a fringe TE1, at best, in recent seasons, and it's fair to expect that to continue.",

The Utah product is a receiving TE who caught 16 TDs and handled a healthy 16% target share during 31 collegiate games. A big chunk of that came during a breakout 2022 campaign in which he posted a 70-890-8 receiving line in 12 games. Kincaid has a ways to go as a blocker, but has big-time skills in the passing game, which will eventually supply him with TE1 upside. In the meantime, however, he'll file in behind Dawson Knox on the Buffalo depth chart. The Bills' pass-heavy, high-scoring offense figure to help Kincaid to the occasional big play, but rookie TEs rarely deliver consistent starting-caliber fantasy production, so he only needs to be drafted with a late flier.",

Toney appeared in 12 games in a season and half with New York and was limited to 13.3 snaps per game in 10 appearances with the Chiefs (three missed games during that span). Toney has thus far been hard to count on, but he has a massive ceiling with the likes of Marques Valdes-Scantling, Skyy Moore and rookie Rashee Rice as his top competition for WR reps in the Chiefs' elite, pass-heavy offense. The 24-year-old is worth a mid-to-late-round flier, and may luck be in your favor.",

Boyd has finished between 36th (2020) and 45th (2022) in fantasy PPG during the last three seasons and has cleared five TDs once in his career (seven in 2018). Last season, Boyd averaged 4.8 targets per game (13% share) in 11 full games with Higgins and Ja'Marr Chase and 5.7 per game (15% share) when one or both were injured. The 28-year-old lacks standalone value, but he'd be in the flex discussion in the Bengals' high-scoring, pass-heavy offense if Chase or Higgins were to miss time.",

That role hasn't allowed any consistent fantasy production (outside the top 50 in fantasy PPG both seasons), but Osborn did start to chip away at Adam Thielen's workload late last season (14.8 or more fantasy points in four of his final five games). Thielen has since been released, but Minnesota \"replaced\" him with first-round pick Jordan Addison. That leaves Osborn no higher than fourth in line for targets behind Justin Jefferson, T.J. Hockenson and Addison. Minnesota ranks fifth in offensive TDs over the past three seasons, which makes the 26-year-old an interesting sleeper, but only in deep leagues.",

The 2019 second-round pick appeared in all 17 games in 2022 after injuries limited him to 15 of a possible 49 games (31%) during his first three seasons. Campbell ranked eighth at wide receiver in routes last season but was 50th or worse in yards, TDs and fantasy PPG. He has generally been a short-range target (career 8.4 aDOT) with minimal goal line work (five TDs and three end zone targets in 32 games). The 26-year-old is positioned for a big early-season role in New York, but things will be a bit more uncertain once Wan'Dale Robinson and Sterling Shepard return from torn ACLs. Campbell's shaky durability and lack of career production suggest he's worth no more than a late flier in deep leagues.",

From that point forward, the Maryland product handled a 13% target share (3.3 per game) despite only running a route on 37% of the Titans' pass plays. He wasn't much of a fantasy option (he ranked 26th with 6.9 PPG) and struggled with drops, but he flashed upside by finishing top two at TE in yards per target (10.0), yards per reception (14.1) and RAC (7.9). Only four TEs had more receiving yards after Week 8. Austin Hooper departed via free agency, leaving Okonkwo clearly atop the depth chart in Mike Vrabel's TE-friendly offense. Okonkwo is an intriguing breakout candidate worth a look in the late rounds.",

The third-round pick immediately stepped into a substantial role and averaged 5.4 targets per game while playing 75% of the snaps in his 10 appearances. Dulcich was limited to two TDs in Denver's struggling offense, but his role as a vertical target (11.0 aDOT ranked third among TEs) allowed him 8.6 fantasy PPG, which was 17th-best at the position. That 8.6 mark also ranks seventh best among rookie TEs over the last decade. The 23-year-old's role appears set to change in new coach Sean Payton's offense (Adam Trautman has a leg up for starting duties), but he looked good enough as a rookie to be worth a late-round lottery ticket.",

The Niners allowed the fewest points and yards last season and have now finished fifth or better in yards allowed each of the last four seasons. This unit's top seven players in 2022 snaps are back, and superstar defensive tackle Javon Hargrave was added to a loaded front 7 that also includes the likes of Nick Bosa, Arik Armstead and Fred Warner. The 49ers' defense remains stacked, so even after a notable coordinator change (DeMeco Ryans replaced by Steve Wilks), the unit is primed for another huge season. The San Francisco D/ST should be one of the first selected on draft day.",

The Steelers actually led the NFL in sacks in five consecutive seasons prior to falling to 14th in 2022. Pittsburgh has also finished top 2 in INTs three of the last four seasons, including a league-high 20 last year. The Steelers have finished outside the top 12 in yards and points allowed two years in a row, which is what has limited their fantasy output. The good news is that while this defense did turn over a bit during the offseason, it will have a healthy T.J. Watt back in a lineup that also includes stars Cameron Heyward, Minkah Fitzpatrick and newcomer Patrick Peterson. The Steelers' D/ST makes for a fine fantasy option.",

Despite not showing well in pass-rush win rate (including a last-place finish in 2022), New Orleans has been a sack juggernaut, ranking no lower than eighth in six consecutive seasons (including fifth in 2022). New Orleans struggled to force turnovers last season (ranked 31st with 13) but allowed the fifth-fewest yards and points. The Saints had a few offseason losses but remain stocked with talent (most notably Demario Davis, Tyrann Mathieu, Cameron Jordan, Marcus Maye and Marshon Lattimore) and will benefit from what is arguably the league's easiest schedule. Expect another solid fantasy showing from the Saints' D/ST.",

Miami finished 30th in forced turnovers last season (14) but was one of the best in terms of forcing pressure (50% pass-rush win rate ranked third). Led by Jerome Baker, Christian Wilkins, Jaelan Phillips and Bradley Chubb (who was traded to Miami last season), Miami's front 7 is stacked, and a secondary led by Xavien Howard and Jevon Holland is also in outstanding shape. Especially with Vic Fangio now running the show, the Dolphins' D/ST is positioned for a big leap in 2023.",

In terms of 2022 snaps, Dallas has 17 of its top 19 defenders under contract for this season. The Cowboys made one of the biggest defensive acquisitions of the offseason, trading for Stephon Gilmore, and the standout corner adds more star power to a unit that also incudes Micah Parsons, DeMarcus Lawrence and Trevon Diggs. This defense has talent on all levels and is well positioned for a third-straight strong fantasy campaign.",

The Browns finished around midpack in most categories in 2022 and offset a rough showing in sacks (27th) with a handful of big scoring plays (third in D/ST TDs). Speaking of the latter, new return man Jakeem Grant is tied for the league lead with six return TDs since 2016 and adds some D/ST value. New DC Jim Schwartz inherits a defense that will return nine of its top 11 players in 2022 snaps. Notable departures John Johnson, Jadeveon Clowney and Taven Bryan were replaced by Juan Thornhill, Ogbonnia Okoronkwo and star Dalvin Tomlinson. Led by Myles Garrett and Denzel Ward, this Browns D/ST has some upside and will, at worst, be a viable streaming option.",

They struggled to generate turnovers (28th) but jumped from 25th to seventh in sacks and from dead last in yards and points allowed to fourth and third, respectively. The defense will return nine of its top 10 players in 2022 snaps, and the only exception (Lamarcus Joyner) might prove to be an upgrade (Chuck Clark). Robert Saleh's defense isn't perfect, but it has some standout pieces, including elite DT Quinnen Williams, a terrific CB duo (Ahmad Gardner, D.J. Reed) and an edge rusher room with a ton of upside (Carl Lawson, John Franklin-Myers, Jermaine Johnson, Will McDonald IV). The Jets D/ST has the look of a fringe fantasy starter.",

The Patriots have also had a knack for scoring non-offensive TDs, producing at least three in five straight seasons. Incredibly, of the top 22 Patriots defenders in 2022 snaps, 21 remain under contract, with retired Devin McCourty the exception. As usual, the Patriots defense doesn't look loaded on paper, but it's solid across the board and Bill Belichick almost always gets the most out of his personnel. You can never go wrong with the New England D/ST.",

The Packers have been terrific at forcing turnovers, ranking sixth or better in INTs three of the last four seasons, but their 34 sacks in 2022 ranked 27th and was their worst showing in well over a decade. Most of Green Bay's defensive core remains under contract for 2023 (16 of the top 19 in 2022 snaps, in fact), though Adrian Amos and Jarran Reed are notable exceptions. The likes of Kenny Clark, Preston Smith, De'Vondre Campbell and Jaire Alexander supply Green Bay with playmakers on each level and set this unit up for another solid D/ST campaign.",
