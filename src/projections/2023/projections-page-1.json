Jefferson was fantasy's top-scoring WR despite some bad luck in the TD department (eight TDs, 10.4 expected), and he has ranked top 5 in end zone targets each of the last two seasons. The 24-year-old should be the first wide receiver off the board and is a strong option if you have the first overall pick in your draft.",

The 2021 first-round pick has finished top 5 among WRs in touchdowns, end zone targets and fantasy PPG in both of his professional seasons. The Bengals called the league's second-pass heaviest offense last season, and Chase has separated himself from Tee Higgins as Joe Burrow's clear No. 1 target. The 23-year-old is an elite fantasy option and a candidate to pace the WR position in points this season.",

The dual-threat back has finished fourth or better at RB in fantasy points three of the past four seasons and his 38 TDs since the start of 2021 are 12 more than any other player. Ekeler caught 107 passes last season (fifth most in the entire NFL) and he's finished no lower than second among RBs in targets, receptions, receiving yards and receiving TDs each of the past two seasons. Ekeler's receiving ability supplies him with an extremely high floor and his heavy usage in a good Chargers offense makes him a strong candidate for the first pick in 2023 fantasy drafts.",

After injuries derailed his 2020 and 2021 campaigns, McCaffrey got back on track in a big way in 2023, appearing in 17 games and ranking no lower than fourth among RBs in touches, yards, TDs and fantasy points. A healthy Elijah Mitchell could limit McCaffrey's fantasy upside a bit this season (the two split carries when Mitchell was healthy last season), but CMC's massive receiving role in a good offense should allow him to finish top five at RB in fantasy PPG for the sixth straight season. The 27-year-old should be off the board early in the first round.",

Kelce set new career-best marks in targets, receptions and TDs and has now finished no lower than second among TEs in catches, yards and fantasy points each of the past seven seasons. Incredibly, Kelce was a top-10 fantasy scorer in 76% of his games, whereas only two other tight ends were over 50%. Kansas City didn't make any major offseason adds at wideout, so Kelce remains locked in as Patrick Mahomes' top target. Kelce is the clear-cut No. 1 TE in fantasy and the 33-year-old should be selected in the middle of the first round in drafts.",

Kupp is entering his age 30 season and has missed time due to injury in four of the last five seasons, but there was clearly no drop-off in his production last season.

Despite moving on from Patrick Mahomes, Hill set career-high marks in target share (30%), targets, receptions, yardage and fantasy points. Hill finished second among WRs in fantasy points and was a top-25 scorer in a ridiculous 15 of 17 weeks. Hill scored eight TDs, and that number likely would've been higher with a healthy Tua Tagovailoa (he caught zero TDs in games Tagovailoa was out or left injured). Hill remains in his prime at age 29 and is on the short list of players with a legitimate shot to lead the WR position in fantasy points.",

Robinson's collegiate rushing efficiency was elite, as he posted a 4.1 YAC (fourth in this year's rookie class) and 3.0 forced missed tackle rate (first) during 31 games. He's also a capable receiver, having posted a 60-805-8 line in his career, which included a class best YPR (13.4) and YPT (9.8). All six RBs drafted in the top 10 since 2011 have finished their rookie season top 15 in fantasy PPG (three finished top five), which only adds to Robinson's 2023 appeal. He's a no-brainer top pick in 2023 rookie drafts and a strong RB1 with elite upside in season-long formats.",

After injuries cost him 21 games during the 2019-21 seasons, Barkley bounced back in a big way in 2022, pacing the position in snaps and finishing top five in carries, targets, touches, scrimmage yards and fantasy points. Barkley's efficiency hasn't quite jumped off the page, especially as a receiver (4.5 YPT on 135 targets over the past two seasons), and we did see a bit of a drop-off as the 2022 season progressed (third in PPG during Weeks 1-10, 12th from Week 11 on). Still, he's in his prime at age 26, one of the league's most gifted backs and sees a ton of volume as both a rusher and receiver. Barkley is a strong RB1.",

              "seasonOutlook": "Henry is back for his eighth season in Tennessee following another huge showing in 2022. The big man led the NFL in carries for the third time in four seasons and showed he was still at the top of his game, averaging 2.54 yards after contact (third highest). Henry expanded his game a bit as well, setting career-high marks in targets, receptions and receiving yards, while pacing all backs in yards per reception and yards per target. Henry is entering his age-29 season, but he's been a top-four fantasy back on a per-game basis each of the past four seasons and he's shown no signs of slowing down. Especially with the expanded passing-game role, Henry is secure as a midrange RB1.",

The ex-Packer paced all WRs in target share (32%) and air yards (2,137) en route to his third consecutive top 3 fantasy campaign. In fact, Adams hasn't finished lower than third in target share or sixth in fantasy PPG since 2017. Adams' role changed a bit last season (more downfield targets), which led to an ugly 56% catch rate, but he figures to revert back to seeing more high percentage looks with conservative Jimmy Garoppolo replacing Derek Carr under center. Adams is now 30 years old, but likely still has another season or two of elite play in the tank. He's a midrange WR1.",

              "seasonOutlook": "Pollard has finally found his way atop the depth chart in Dallas following the offseason release of Ezekiel Elliott. After three seasons as a change-of-pace back, the 2019 fourth-round pick proved too good to keep off the field and was operating in a near-even split with Elliott in 2022. Pollard finished 21st among backs in touches, but was 12th in yardage, sixth in TDs and eighth in fantasy points. Absurdly efficient, Pollard ranks third in rushing EPA per carry, third in yards per carry (5.13) and first in YAC (2.43) since he was drafted. Pollard has shown that he can provide high-end efficiency with added volume and will be working behind a good offensive line in Dallas. He's a top-10 fantasy option.",

Chubb has produced at least 996 yards and eight TDs on the ground during all five NFL seasons and he has the efficiency to match; he ranks first in yards per carry (5.24) and fourth in YAC (2.31) since he was drafted. Chubb has finished top 12 in fantasy points each of the past four seasons, but he's yet to crack the top five due to his limited role in the passing game (he's never finished a season top 20 among RBs in targets, receptions or receiving yards). The 27-year-old is an extremely solid fringe RB1 (with added value in non-PPR), but his ceiling is limited.",

The 2020 first-round pick set career-high marks across the board and finished no lower than seventh among WRs in target share (28%), targets, receptions, yards, TDs and, of course, fantasy points. If there's one red flag here, it's that Lamb wasn't used much near the end zone (career-low six end zone targets) and ended up a bit lucky in the TD department (nine TDs, 5.4 expected). Of course, even if the TDs fall a bit, the 24-year-old is all but assured a massive target share and is one of the league's most-talented young receivers. Lamb is a midrange WR1, and it's possible we've yet to see his best season.",

The first-round pick out of Ohio State finished sixth in targets and fifth in end zone targets (13), which powered him to a 21st-place finish in fantasy points. Improved QB play would've pushed Wilson even higher, as he was held to four TDs (7.9 expected) and his 56% catch rate ranked near the basement of the league. Help is, of course, on the way, as the Jets traded for Aaron Rodgers during the offseason. With the future MVP under center, the sky is the limit for Wilson. The 23-year-old is a fringe fantasy WR1 with elite upside.",

Despite missing one game last season, St. Brown finished seventh among WRs in fantasy PPG. St. Brown's short-range/slot role has led to a ton of high-percentage targets (career 74% catch rate) but not much work near the goal line (career 11 receiving TDs and eight end zone targets). The 23-year-old is the real deal and is locked into another massive target share this season. He's a solid WR1 target.",

The former Titan posted career-high marks in target share (28%), targets, receptions, receiving yards, end zone targets (11) and fantasy points. He also matched a career-high with 11 TDs, which ranked second among WRs. Brown has always been a target monster (top 8 in target share each of the last three seasons) and continues to post elite efficiency (he ranked no lower than fourth among WRs in yards per target, YPRR and RAC last season). The 26-year-old is sharing No. 1 WR duties with DeVonta Smith, but the Eagles' offense can certainly support two top-10 fantasy receivers again this season.",

The 2019 first-round pick put up massive rushing and receiving lines en route to pacing the league in touches (393) and scrimmage yards (2,053). It was easily Jacobs' best NFL season, but he's always been solid, having yet to finish a season lower than 15th among RBs in rushing yards or fantasy PPG. Incredibly, Jacobs has scored 40 rushing and zero receiving TDs in his career despite ranking top 15 at RB in receiving yards each of the past two seasons. Backs who see 300-plus carries tend to miss games and drop off the following season, but Jacobs can afford that and still provide midrange RB1 value. The 25-year-old is worth a look at the Round 1/2 turn.",

Last season, he missed six games and was held to 1,004 yards and four TDs, ranking 18th in fantasy PPG (14th during 10 full games). Taylor's usage actually didn't change much (from 19.5 carries and 3.1 targets per game in 2021 to 19.2 carries and 3.9 targets per game in 2022), but his efficiency (3.6 yards per target ranked last at RB) and scoring plummeted. On the plus side, he finished strong (RB6 in fantasy PPG during the final four games) and he enters 2023 healthy and with a new coach (Shane Steichen) and QB (Anthony Richardson) in what is likely to be a run-heavy offense. Only 24 years old and positioned as a feature back, Taylor is set up for a big rebound season and will remain a solid RB1 if he gets his contract situation sorted.",

As a rookie in 2021, Waddle was a short-range target (7.0 aDOT) and caught 104 passes for 1,015 yards and six TDs. Last season, Waddle played more of a downfield role (12.0 aDOT) and led all WRs in yards per reception (18.1) and yards per target (11.6) while finishing second in RAC (7.0). His reception total plummeted, but his yardage skyrocketed and his numbers actually would've been better if Tua Tagovailoa missed less time (287 yards and zero TDs in five games Tagovailoa was out or left injured). More goal line work would be nice (he has eight career end zone targets), but Waddle is a budding star and a featured target in a good offense. The 24-year-old is a fringe WR1.",

Instead, Metcalf hit career highs in targets and receptions en route to his third consecutive top-16 fantasy campaign. Metcalf has actually finished outside the top 20 in fantasy PPG each of the last two seasons, but he hasn't missed a single game and he had some horrific TD luck last season. The big man saw 24 end zone targets (nine more than any other player) but found the end zone only six times (nearly half of his WR-high expected total of 11.0). Metcalf is in his prime at age 25, a lock for a huge target share and a good bet for more TDs. He's a fringe WR1.",

It was a solid showing for Higgins, but it would've been even better had he not left three games early due to injury. In fact, if we eliminate those three games (which included a total of two targets), Higgins leaps to 11th among WRs in fantasy PPG (16.6) during his 13 full games. Higgins is 6-foot-4, so it's a bit surprising that he has yet to clear seven TDs in a season and that he only saw five end zone targets last season (46 WRs had more). Nonetheless, the 24-year-old is a big part of a high-scoring, pass-heavy Bengals' offense, which positions him as a good fantasy WR2.",

Olave was heavily utilized as a vertical target (his 14.2 aDOT ranked sixth in the league) and extremely efficient (his 2.5 YPRR ranked seventh and his 0.34 fantasy points per snap ranked sixth). Olave finished top 20 among WRs in targets and yards despite finishing 69th in snaps and 49th in routes, so there is still plenty of room for growth for the 23-year-old. With Derek Carr now under center, Olave is positioned for a leap forward in 2023. He's safest as a WR2, but there's upside for more.",

Smith didn't have as many big weeks as Brown (three top-10 fantasy outings) but had a very high floor (12 top-30 weeks) and ended up ninth among WRs in points. Smith finished no lower than 18th in target share, YPT, catch rate and YPRR during his huge second season. The 24-year-old is still on the ascent and, even with Brown in the mix, has a path to another top 15 fantasy campaign in the Eagles' elite offense.",

Mahomes proceeded to lead the league in passing yards (career-high 5,242), pass TDs (41) and fantasy points (417) en route to winning league MVP and the Super Bowl. Mahomes' fantasy floor was absurdly high, as his worst weekly finish was 13th in Week 2. He continues to load up the box score through the air and also posted career-high marks in rushing yards (358) and TDs (four) last season. Kansas City's WR room is unproven but has plenty of potential in youngsters Kadaraius Toney, Skyy Moore and Rashee Rice. Mahomes enters his age-27 season locked in as an elite fantasy option in Andy Reid's pass-heavy offense.",

The 27-year-old was his usual dominant self in 2022, posting 13 top-10 fantasy outings, which tied Patrick Mahomes for the most (in one fewer game). Allen continues to get the job done through the air (no lower than eighth in passing yards and TDs each of the last three seasons) and on the ground (no lower than seventh among QBs in rushing yards and TDs all five seasons). Allen's supporting cast is a bit underwhelming behind Stefon Diggs, but his dual-threat game in Buffalo's pass-heavy offense locks him in as an elite fantasy option.",

Hurts actually paced all QBs in fantasy points per game (25.2) and was a top-six scorer at the position in eight consecutive weeks. The 25-year-old led all QBs in carries (165) and rush TDs (13), and his heavy goal line role allowed 20 carries inside the opponent's 5-yard line, which ranked second in the entire league. Hurts is set up for success again in 2023, with an elite offensive line and a terrific group of targets led by A.J. Brown, DeVonta Smith and Dallas Goedert. Hurts is, at worst, a top-three fantasy option at the position.",

The 2017 second-round pick's rushing volume and efficiency (3.9 YPC, career-worst 1.7 YAC) slipped a bit last season, but that was covered up by a big role near the goal line and career-high marks in targets, receptions and receiving yards. Mixon finished the season top 10 in fantasy PPG for the third consecutive season, but he missed three games due to injury and has now produced one full season in his career (2019). He also saw his snap share plummet from 73% to 53% once back from the injury. Of course. the 27-year-old benefits from an elite Bengals offense and he has minimal competition for touches following the departure of Samaje Perine. Mixon is best viewed as a good RB2.",

Etienne first took on feature back duties in Week 7 and (excluding a Week 12 game that he left early) was 14th among backs in fantasy PPG from that point forward. Etienne had some terrible TD luck (five TDs despite ranking 10th among backs in both yards and expected TDs -- 9.2) and is a good bet for a boost this season. Etienne is the lead back in a good, emerging Jaguars offense and has the skill set to be a threat as a rusher and receiver. He's a fringe RB1 with elite upside.",

The 2022 first-round pick has yet to miss a game and while he's ranked top five among RBs in carries both seasons, he did see a big drop-off in production from 2021 to 2022. Harris experienced a big dip in touches (381 to 313), yardage (1,667 to 1,263) and fantasy PPG (17.7 to 13.1) primarily due to a substantially decreased receiving role (from 94 targets to 54). On the plus side, Harris has scored 10 TDs in both pro seasons and he finished 2022 strong with five consecutive top-20 fantasy outings. The 25-year-old's role adjustment makes him more of a fringe RB1 than an elite fantasy back, but improvements along the line and at QB (Kenny Pickett's second season) are reasons for optimism.",

The Alabama product's carry count (and perhaps goal line TDs) may be limited by his size (5-foot-9, 199 lbs.), but he has the speed (4.36 40-yard dash), quickness and hands to be a major difference-maker in the passing game. Gibbs' tackle-breaking, elusiveness and YAC numbers were solid-to-good in 31 collegiate games, but he mixed in a ton of negative runs (rookie-class-high 24%). He made up for that with a 104-1,217-8 receiving line (which included elite efficiency) during the span. Gibbs will team up with David Montgomery in a Detroit backfield that scored a league-high 501 fantasy points in 2023. Especially behind the Lions' elite offensive line, Gibbs has immediate RB2 value in fantasy.",

The 2017 fifth-round pick has been as reliable as they come, finishing inside the top 15 at RB in targets, receptions and scrimmage yards each of the past four seasons. His rushing efficiency has been nothing short of elite -- he sits second in yards per carry (5.1) among 40 RBs with 550-plus carries since he was drafted in 2017. Jones has 11 receiving TDs over the past two seasons, though his goal line work has been trending down (two carries inside the 5-yard line last season) and helps explain why he produced only three top-10 fantasy weeks in 2022. The 28-year-old will continue to share the backfield with AJ Dillon and the offense figures to lose some steam with Aaron Rodgers gone, so Jones is best viewed as a good RB2.",

The former fourth-round pick finished no lower than 10th among backs in touches (279), yards (1,461) and fantasy points, with his passing-game chops the primary driver of success (his 89 targets and 69 catches were both top five among RBs). Stevenson hasn't seen much work near the goal line, but he was unlucky in the TD department last season (six TDs, 8.0 expected). Ex-running mate Damien Harris was replaced by Ezekiel Elliott, who figures to be more of a complement than he will be a serious threat to Stevenson's workload. Perhaps new playcaller Bill O'Brien will lean more on a committee attack, but 25-year-old Stevenson's floor should be that of a mid-range RB2.",

              "seasonOutlook": "Samuel had a bit of a setback last season, posting 864 yards and five TDs on 98 touches in 13 games. This after the versatile playmaker racked up 1,770 yards and 14 TDs on 136 touches in 2021. Samuel fell from third to 28th at wide receiver in fantasy PPG, and his season was horrifically inefficient; despite a position-low 4.0 aDOT, he caught only 61% of his targets and averaged 6.1 yards per target. Samuel's dual-threat role is not ideal for durability (he's yet to complete a full regular season in four years), but it is great for generating touches (7.75 per game last season). Even in a crowded offense, the heavy usage is enough to keep the 27 year old in the WR2 mix.",

Believe it or not, Ridley is entering his age-28 season with one career top-20 fantasy campaign (fifth, back in 2020), and he was 24th in fantasy PPG during a 2021 season cut short by a Week 7 season-ending injury. Ridley is obviously a bit of an unknown after all the missed time, but he has flashed elite talent in the past and is, by all accounts, healthy and primed for a major role in the up-and-coming Jaguars offense. Ridley will have more competition for targets than he did in Atlanta, but if he's his old self, a return to the WR2 (or perhaps WR1) mix is attainable. He's risky, but worth a look in the early-to-middle rounds.",

In fact, Allen finished eight consecutive weeks top 30 in scoring at WR and ranked third at the position in fantasy PPG (18.8) during the span. This after Allen finished the prior five seasons no lower than 13th in targets, receptions and fantasy points. Allen is now 31 years old and has missed 11 games due to injury over the last three seasons, but he's still positioned as a featured target in an elite offense. Allen has the look of a high-floor WR2 in PPR formats.",

The 2018 third-round pick actually saw a massive step backward in production from 2021 (107-1,361-9 receiving line) to 2022, but still ended up no lower than third in targets, receptions and yardage at the position. Lamar Jackson's injury loomed large, as Andrews posted a 49-568-5 receiving line in nine full games with Jackson (15.4 fantasy PPG, ranked second), compared to 21-246-0 in five games without him (9.1 PPG, 17th). Baltimore upgraded at wide receiver a bit, but Andrews can afford a dip from his TE-high 29% target share and still provide elite fantasy numbers. The 28-year-old is the best TE in fantasy not named Travis Kelce.",

              "seasonOutlook": "Since pacing all QBs with 416 fantasy points in 2019, Jackson has struggled with injuries, missing 11 games over the last two seasons (including five each in 2021 and 2022). The good news is that he has remained a strong fantasy option when healthy. Despite posting a career-low 6.9 YPA on 326 pass attempts last season, Jackson was fifth among QBs in fantasy points per game prior to his Week 13 injury. Jackson finished the season second at the position in rushing yards and has yet to finish a season lower than second in the category. Jackson's targets are much improved this season, with Odell Beckham Jr. and Zay Flowers added to a group that includes Mark Andrews and Rashod Bateman. Jackson's dual-threat ability and the potential for more passing under new playcaller Todd Monken is enough to make him a midrange QB1 with elite upside.",

Burrow's efficiency stats predictably came back to earth, but he offset it with more volume as both a passer and rusher. After totaling a 40-118-2 rushing line in 2021, Burrow finished no lower than eighth among QBs in carries (75), rush TDs (five) and carries inside the opponent's 5-yard line (seven) last season. The 26-year-old has emerged as one of the league's top quarterbacks and he'll again have the elite Ja'Marr Chase/Tee Higgins duo at his disposal. Burrow is a top-five fantasy QB.",

Cooper also matched his career-best fantasy finish (10th), and that was with Deshaun Watson suspended for 11 games. He has now finished all eight of his NFL seasons between 14th and 31st in fantasy PPG.

The 2022 second-round pick didn't see the field much early on in his rookie campaign, first stepping into an every-down role in Week 10. From that point forward, he produced 584 yards and eight TDs on 35 touches. That accounted for the 10th-most fantasy points at the position. The TD rate is obviously unsustainable, but Watson's 23% target share (6.5 per game) and strong play (85th percentile or better in YPR, YPT, aDOT, RAC and YPRR) suggest he's the real deal. Granted, Aaron Rodgers is gone, but Watson has little competition for targets in Green Bay and his contributions as a rusher add to his floor. The 24-year-old is a fringe WR2.",

              "seasonOutlook": "Hopkins signed with the Titans in July after he was released by the Cardinals earlier in the offseason. The veteran receiver has struggled to stay on the field of late, totaling 15 missed games over the past two seasons. After a step back in usage and production in 2021, Hopkins did enjoy a nice rebound last season. He soaked up a healthy 29% target share (sixth-highest at WR) and was ninth at WR in fantasy PPG during his nine games. Hopkins is past his prime at age 31, but after the strong showing last season, it's possible he has one more big season in the tank. Tennessee operates a run-heavy scheme, which will limit Hopkins' ceiling, but he's positioned for a big target share and remains in the WR2 mix.",

Godwin's short-range role (5.9 aDOT) limited his yardage and he wasn't much of a factor near the goal line (four end zone targets), but he still managed his fourth consecutive top-15 finish in fantasy PPG. The 27-year-old has some durability concerns (he has missed at least two games in four consecutive seasons), but the larger issue here is the departure of Tom Brady. Tampa Bay has operated an extremely pass-heavy offense during the Brady era, but that will change with Baker Mayfield and/or Kyle Trask under center. Godwin will see enough volume to produce borderline WR2 production.",

The 2019 third-round pick finished no lower than 10th among WRs in snaps, routes and targets, while also handling 10 end zone targets (13th-most). Johnson continues to struggle with efficiency (his 6.50 YPT is dead last among 53 WRs with 200-plus targets over the last three seasons), but his volume has remained high and the TD deficiency was an outlier (he scored 20 TDs during his first three seasons). Especially with Kenny Pickett likely in for some Year 2 progression, Johnson is well positioned for a rebound campaign. The 26-year-old is a fringe WR2.",

Pierce was promoted into a feature role in Week 2 of his rookie campaign and was fantasy's No. 14 RB prior to missing the final four games of the season with an ankle injury. The 2022 fourth-round pick had trouble finding the end zone (five TDs on 250 touches) and with receiving efficiency (4.1 yards per target), though neither is a shock considering the team's QB woes. Pierce may see a reduction from the 16.9 carries and 3.1 targets per game he saw last season with Singletary in the mix, but the 23-year-old looks the part of a lead back and is primed for a step forward in 2023. He's in the RB2 mix.",

The 2022 second-round pick started in a timeshare before taking over lead back duties and reeling off five consecutive top-15 fantasy weeks prior to the injury. Hall had two games with double-digit targets and was sixth at RB in fantasy points through Week 6. He finished second at the position in both yards per carry and yards per reception. Hall has elite upside and is a fantasy RB1 when healthy, but he may open 2023 in a limited role behind newcomer Dalvin Cook. Expect a slow start and a strong finish for the budding star.",

The 2022 third-round pick produced 64 yards on 14 carries and caught all nine of his targets for 45 yards. White ended up 11th among RBs in receptions as a rookie and, with only Chase Edmonds as serious competition for touches, the second-year back is well positioned for a much larger role. Even in an offense that may struggle without Tom Brady, White is one of the top RB breakout candidates in fantasy this season.",

The 2019 first-round pick was a solid producer with the Lions, but really hit his stride after the trade. From Week 9 on, Hockenson averaged 14.1 fantasy PPG, which trailed only Travis Kelce at the position. His 86 targets (9.6 per game, 24% team share) during the span ranked fifth in the entire league. Including the playoffs, Hockenson saw 10-plus targets in five of his 10 full games with the Vikings (he saw 10-plus in seven of 47 games in Detroit). A boost in TDs would be nice (he's yet to clear six in a season), but with only Justin Jefferson certainly ahead of him for targets in an offense that ranks sixth in TDs during the Kirk Cousins era, the 26-year-old has found his way to top-five (perhaps top-three) status at the position.",

Kamara actually scored 20% of his fantasy points in one game (Week 8) and was limited to five weekly finishes better than 18th (four of which came consecutively). On the plus side, Kamara has finished top five among RBs in targets and top 12 in yards in all six NFL seasons despite often missing games (at least one in each of the past five seasons). Kamara's massive passing-game usage is enough to keep him in the top-10 mix when active, but the suspension, his age (28) and the arrival of goal line threat Jamaal Williams mean he's best valued as a mid-to-back-end RB2.",
