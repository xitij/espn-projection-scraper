Murray has been the poster boy for mediocrity, having finished each of the past four seasons with a yards per carry mark no higher than 4.13 and no lower than 3.90. Murray has been between 103 and 264 receiving yards each of the past three seasons. The area where Murray has stood out is the touchdown department. Since 2015, he ranks second in the NFL in rushing touchdowns (32), fourth in rushing OTD (27.7) and fifth in carries inside the 5-yard line (40). Murray is a sneaky flex in touchdown-only leagues, but his real appeal is as arguably the most valuable handcuff in fantasy. If Kamara goes down, Murray will be in the RB1 mix.",

McCoy carried the ball 161 times (his lowest total since 2009) and was targeted on 43 occasions (his lowest since 2014). McCoy struggled to a career-low 3.19 YPC (third-worst at the position) and finished dead last in YAC (0.96) for the second consecutive season. McCoy's best weekly finish was 13th, and he failed to finish as a top-20 fantasy back for the first time since 2009. McCoy has rushed for six or fewer touchdowns four of the past five seasons. He's entering his age-31 season as Buffalo's lead back, but he'll defer work to newcomers Frank Gore, TJ Yeldon and Devin Singletary, and figures to lose touchdown opportunities to Josh Allen. McCoy is a low-ceiling flex option.",

Although the 27-year-old's efficiency has dipped after an explosive start to his career, Hyde has often ranked near the top of the league in stacked boxes (76th percentile or higher in average box defenders in four of his five seasons) and quietly posted a solid 1.9 YAC last season. Hyde figures to find more open lanes in Andy Reid's running-back-friendly offense. He isn't an effective receiver, but there's big upside if he knocks off Damien Williams for lead back duties. Hyde is a post-hype target worth a late-round flier.",

A master in rushing efficiency, Henderson averaged an astounding 8.88 yards per carry on 130 attempts in 2017 before improving to 8.92 YPC on 214 carries in 2018. The Memphis product averaged 6.0 yards after contact per attempt last season, which is higher than the yards per carry of all but five of the backs who attended the combine. Henderson is small (5-foot-8, 208 pounds) but elusive and has decent speed (4.49 40-yard dash). Henderson likely won't have standalone fantasy value as long as Todd Gurley (even if he's scaled back a bit) is healthy, but he's certainly a very valuable handcuff, especially considering Gurley struggled through the latter part of last season with a knee injury. Henderson belongs on the bench in most leagues.",

Moncrief's best season came in 2015 in which he posted a 64/733/6 line and was fantasy's No. 36 scoring wideout. He missed 11 games over the next two seasons with Indianapolis before posting a 48/668/3 line in 16 games with Jacksonville last season. Moncrief has underwhelmed thus far in his career, but he has been more productive with Andrew Luck under center and he'll certainly get good quarterback play via Ben Roethlisberger in Pittsburgh. Playing time is there for the taking with the depth chart wide open behind JuJu Smith-Schuster. The 26-year-old is a very intriguing post-hype sleeper.",

Washington, whose vertical role yielded a 16.2 aDOT on 37 targets last season, has WR2 upside if he's able to carve out an every-down role in his second season.

Healthy and operating as Green Bay's No. 3 wide receiver during Weeks 1-4, Allison posted a 19/289/2 line and was fantasy's No. 28 scorer at the position. Allison has registered only 55 catches in 30 career games, but his strong 2018 efficiency (67 percent catch rate, 10.1 YPT) and the Packers' shaky depth chart positions him well for a run at No. 2 duties opposite Davante Adams. In that scenario, Allison would, at least, be on the flex radar. He's an intriguing late-round sleeper.",

He averaged 5.7 yards after the catch, which was 11th best at the position. Especially with Randall Cobb gone, the Packers' wide receiver depth chart is wide open. Valdes-Scantling, who stands 6-foot-5 and aligned in the slot on 46 percent of his routes as a rookie, will have a shot at flex value if he locks down No. 2 or perhaps No. 3 duties in Green Bay's Aaron Rodgers-led offense. He's worth a late flier.",

A dangerous threat down the seam, Njoku has ranked top 11 at the position in aDOT in each of his two pro seasons. Last season's 16 percent target share figures to decrease slightly with Beckham in the fold, but it's possible Njoku overcomes that with an extra touchdown or two (he has exactly four in each of his two seasons).

Ebron finished in the top six at the position in targets (111), receptions (66) and receiving yards (five). He paced the position with a whopping 18 end-zone targets. Ebron's path to the huge season was bizarre as, during the six games both he and Jack Doyle were active, Doyle ran 151 routes and was targeted 33 times, compared to 101 routes and 22 targets for Ebron. Doyle returns healthy for 2019, which makes Ebron's regression a strong bet. The 26-year-old is best valued as a fringe TE1.",

Prescott was limited by 56 sacks last season (second most), but the return of center Travis Frederick should help cut that number down. The 25-year-old gets the job done with his arm, is one of the game's better rushing quarterbacks and has Amari Cooper, second-year Michael Gallup and now Jason Witten and Randall Cobb at his disposal. He's a fringe QB1 option.",

In 2018, Brees finished outside the top 10 in pass attempts, completions and yards for the first time since at least 2009. Brees, who has finished third or better in completion percentage nine of the past 10 seasons, has enough talent to post another top-10 season, but a more-balanced offense and fewer late-game deficits has capped his ceiling a bit.",

Losing Brown can't be ignored, but Roethlisberger still has JuJu Smith-Schuster, James Conner and a strong offensive line at his disposal. He's a solid QB1 target.",

Wilson posted eight top-10 outings (fifth most), but failed to clear 29 points in a single week. Wilson's 427 pass attempts ranked 20th and were his fewest since 2013. Wilson is a strong candidate for touchdown regression to the mean (his 8.2 percent TD rate ranks third over the past decade). Offensive line remains a concern after Wilson was sacked on 10.7 percent of his dropbacks (fifth highest). Wilson is extremely efficient and adds value with his legs, but Seattle's commitment to a run-heavy offense limits his fantasy upside. He's a back-end QB1.",

The Oklahoma product is extremely undersized (5-foot-10, 207 pounds), but exceptionally efficient with his arm (he set an FBS record with an 11.6 YPA last season) and highly productive with his legs (1,001 rushing yards while averaging 7.2 YPC last season). There have been only three top-10 and six top-14 fantasy seasons by rookie quarterbacks over the past decade, but all who accomplished that did a lot of damage with their legs -- an area in which Murray will shine. Rookies are always risks, but Murray's skill set and path to snaps means he should be viewed as a QB2 with back-end QB1 upside. He's worth a late-round pick in your draft.",

Goff was fantasy's No. 12 scoring QB in 2017 and improved to No. 7 in 2018. Goff adds little with his legs as he has only tallied 175 rushing yards in 38 career games. His accuracy remains a question, too, finishing no better than in the 63rd percentile in off-target rate each of his three seasons. However, terrific hands (2.1 percent drop rate) and post-catch production (6.2 RAC) from his receivers have led to excellent passing numbers. Goff is a fringe QB1.",

Last season, Jackson was limited to 47 touches, but scored five touchdowns and posted an 18.9 YPR (highest) and 10.8 YPT (sixth highest). His 17.4 YPR and 10.0 YPT are tops in the NFL since he entered the league in 2008. Jackson is likely to miss a game or two and will serve as a situational deep threat behind Zach Ertz and Alshon Jeffery, but this is an offense that ranks fifth in passing attempts and third in passing touchdowns over the past two seasons. He'll see enough work to keep him in the flex discussion in non-PPR.",

Williams was a full-time player, but primarily worked as a situational target throughout his four seasons with the Chargers. A Week 1 Keenan Allen injury forced Williams into No. 1 receiver duties back in 2016 and he delivered with a 69/1059/7 line and an 18th-place finish in fantasy points. That was, by far, Williams' most productive season and he's otherwise failed to eclipse five scores or post a fantasy finish better than 45th. Williams' resume suggests he won't be a high-volume target (he has been limited to a 13 percent target share each of the past two seasons), but his propensity for big plays (career 16.3 YPR) provides optimism that he can push for flex numbers in deeper non-PPR formats.",

The 2015 second-round pick first stepped into a full-time role in 2017 and exploded for a 63/840/8 line and a 22nd-place fantasy campaign. The towering 6-foot-4, 225-pound receiver played a similar role early in 2018, but inefficient play and a change in scheme eventually led to a demotion. Funchess now has a great opportunity to rebound, as the depth chart is wide open behind T.Y. Hilton, he'll enjoy a quarterback upgrade (24.4 percent off-target rate in Carolina was fourth highest) and he figures to be busy near the goal line (ranks 23rd with 32 career end zone targets). The 25-year-old has some upside in the Colts' high-scoring offense. Take a late flier.",

The 2018 second-round pick caught seven touchdowns in 15 games, but saw his targets fall from 5.1 per game during Weeks 1-10 to 1.6 per game during Weeks 11-17. A hefty 26 percent of balls thrown his way were off target (14th highest), but he also struggled with drops (five). Miller's 13.0 percent touchdown rate (third highest) is unsustainable, but he's an obvious candidate for a larger target share in his second season. Mitch Trubisky's shaky accuracy is a concern, but Miller's pedigree supplies him with late-round sleeper appeal.",

Metcalf is huge (6-foot-3, 228 pounds) with terrific explosiveness, speed and downfield play-making ability. The former Ole Miss star is young (he turns 22 in December) and raw, the latter of which can somewhat be attributed to injury woes. Metcalf showed off his speed and size at the combine with a 4.33 40-yard dash and 27 bench reps, though he did raise major red flags by struggling in quickness events. Metcalf has the upside to become one of the league's next premiere vertical receivers, especially with Russell Wilson on the other end of the battery, but his short-term prospects will depend on his development and the status of Doug Baldwin. He figures to be more boom/bust than a consistent producer as a situational deep threat in Seattle's super-run-heavy offense in 2019.",

Despite consistently ranking near the top of the league in these key categories, Brady has posted only two fantasy campaigns better than ninth during the past six campaigns. Limited by a switch to a run-heavy scheme, Brady was held to five top-10 fantasy weeks last season (his fewest in the past decade). Adding concern is the retirement of Rob Gronkowski, as the New England offense saw a large dip in touchdowns, passing yards, completion percentage and yards per attempt during the 29 games Gronkowski missed from 2010 to 2018. Brady is still an elite player, but New England's shaky group of pass-catchers and a run-first offense limits him to QB2 territory.",

Jackson averaged a massive 17.0 carries per game and ranked seventh in the entire NFL with 556 rushing yards during his seven starts. Jackson did, however, struggle as a passer. He completed 58 percent of his passes (fourth worst) and was off target on 22 percent of his throws (second worst). The Baltimore offense averaged 1.9 touchdowns per game during Jackson's starts, which would have ranked seventh worst over the full season. Jackson's legs provide him with QB1 upside, but a lack of passing volume and efficiency, coupled with inherent durability concerns makes him more of a QB2 target.",

That's despite missing only two games in six seasons and despite having scored at least six touchdowns each of the past three seasons. Volume is the chief concern for Stills, as he's ranked higher than 56th at the position in targets once in his career (2017). Stills is a terrific deep threat (he's ranked top 13 in aDOT and Top 22 in YPR each of the past four seasons), but his role as a situational deep threat limits his fantasy upside. In fact, he managed only two weekly finishes better than 25th last season. Stills is best as a DFS tournament option with some season-long flex appeal in deeper non-PPR formats.",

He has scored more than five touchdowns in a season just twice in nine years (2012, 2015). Tate, who has managed six-consecutive Top 30 fantasy campaigns, is suspended for four games to open 2019, but once back, the 31 year old will be a flex option.",

Humphries ranks 24th among wide receivers in receptions (192) over the past three seasons, but 65th in touchdown catches (8, 6.8 OTD) during the span. His role as a short-area target (6.2 aDOT in 2018) who is rarely used near the goal line (12 career end zone targets) has left Humphries without a single top-50 fantasy season in his four-year career. Humphries will be on the field plenty as Tennessee's slot receiver, but he's unlikely to see much work near the goal line and will also be limited by Tennessee's run-heavy scheme. He's a fringe flex option in deep PPR leagues.",

Wilson threw a 52 yard touchdown and posted a 26/391/4 receiving line en route to sitting as fantasy's No. 25 scoring wideout through Week 7. Wilson averaged 13.3 yards after the catch, which was second-best at the position. Miami's depth chart is wide open, which positions Wilson for a generous target share in an offense now led by Josh Rosen. This offense doesn't figure to score often, but an every-down role for the explosive 27-year-old would make him a deep sleeper option.",

He was fantasy's No. 25-scoring receiver that season, but he has been unable to come close to that production since. A sickle trait issue cost Brown game action during his stint in Arizona, but with that behind him, the 29-year-old didn't miss a single game en route to a 42/717/5 line last season. Brown's 14.9 average depth of target is highest in the NFL among 41 players with 400-plus targets since he entered the league. Brown figures to be an extremely boom/bust producer as a situational deep threat for strong-armed but inaccurate Josh Allen. He's only worth a look in deep non-PPR leagues.",

Hooper's primary drawback has been a lack of scoring, as he's yet to clear four touchdowns or five end-zone targets in a season.

The 2013 third-round pick has never played more than 14 games in a regular season and has missed 31 games in six seasons. Reed handled a hefty 23 percent target share (6.9 per game) during the 12 full games he played last season. That aligns exactly with his usage during the 2015-16 seasons and is just above where he was in five full games in 2017 (21 percent). Despite only scoring two touchdowns in Washington's mess of an offense, Reed was fantasy's No. 8 scoring tight end before going down with an injury in Week 14 last season. He'll again be ticketed for a huge role in 2019, though his durability remains a massive concern.",

Burton did score six touchdowns, but his 3.6 OTD and four end-zone targets suggest he was over his head in that department. On the plus side, Burton finished strong with a target share of at least 17 percent during each of the team's final four regular-season games. The 27-year-old is a TE2.",

Andrews did all that damage despite playing only 35 percent of the snaps. Andrews' future looks bright, but he'll need to find ways to stay on the field with 2018 first-round pick Hayden Hurst and re-signed blocker Nick Boyle also on the roster. Andrews is a fine late-round flier, but Baltimore's run-heavy offense will limit his upside.",

Jones is undersized at 5-foot-11, 205 pounds, which might limit his early-down and goal-line opportunities, but the depth chart is wide open in Tampa Bay. He's a post-hype sleeper with tons of raw talent and upside as a receiver. Throw a dart in the late rounds.",

Richard was limited to a career-low 55 carries, but his 80 targets more than doubled his previous career high. He caught 85 percent of his targets (fourth-best) and finished top-eight at the position in yards per target (7.6) for the second season in a row. Although Oakland called pass on 81 percent of Richard's snaps, he averaged more than 4.7 YPC for the third consecutive season. Richard scored only one touchdown, his best weekly fantasy finish was 16th, and he's a candidate for a dip in targets after Oakland revamped at wide receiver. His role as a complement to Josh Jacobs is enough for flex value in deep PPR leagues.",

After averaging 5.0 YPC and a league-best 2.6 YAC in 2017, Lewis averaged 3.3 YPC and 2.0 YAC in 2018. He was more productive as a receiver, catching 59 passes (10th-most among backs) and pacing the position in catch rate (87 percent) for the second consecutive season. Lewis scored two touchdowns, and all four of his top-25 fantasy weeks came prior to Week 11. Following Henry's late-season breakout, Lewis is no more than a change-of-pace back and passing-down specialist. That gives the 28-year-old some deep-league appeal, but he isn't a viable starting option.",

Bernard posted career-low marks in both carries (56) and receptions (35) last season. His 4.7 YPT was second-worst at the position and marks the first time in six seasons that he didn't finish top-20 in the category. Undersized and uninvolved near the goal line, Bernard hasn't cleared four touchdowns in a season since 2014. He is no more than a backup who steals some passing-down work from Mixon. His primary value is as a handcuff.",

After totaling seven targets in his first 10 games, Hamilton handled eight-plus targets during each of Denver's final four games spanning Weeks 14-17. Hamilton was fantasy's No. 22 WR during the span. He primarily lined up in the slot and worked as a short-area target (8.4 aDOT), which allowed a 67 percent catch rate, but only two touchdowns and an ugly 5.4 YPT. The 24-year-old enters his second season with a legitimate path to leading Denver in targets, especially with Emmanuel Sanders recovering from a torn Achilles. Hamilton is a solid mid-to-late round flier.",

Harry is 6-foot-2, 228 pounds and is a strong, physical downfield weapon and good blocker. The Arizona State product is terrific with the ball in his hands and his size makes him a valuable resource near the goal line. Harry's speed (4.53 40-yard dash) and athletic limitations have led to struggles with separation, so he might be best suited for a big slot role in the pros. That makes him a fit in a Patriots offense that moves its receivers around quite often. With Josh Gordon's future in doubt and Demaryius Thomas a strong PUP candidate, Harry has minimal competition for a significant offensive role opposite Julian Edelman in 2019. That's enough to make him well worth a late-round flier.",

They ranked third in sacks with 50. Chicago lost Adrian Amos and Bryce Callahan in free agency but remains stocked with star talent on every level, led by the likes of Akiem Hicks, Khalil Mack, Kyle Fuller, Danny Trevathan and Eddie Jackson. The addition of star returner Cordarrelle Patterson (league-high four kick return touchdowns since 2014) adds to the appeal. This elite unit should be the first off the board in 2019 fantasy drafts.",

They still showed well in yardage allowed (fifth) and points allowed (fourth), however, which salvaged a top-10 fantasy campaign. Malik Jackson's offseason release is notable, but 2018 first-round pick Taven Bryan is waiting in the wings and joins a terrific core led by Calais Campbell, Jalen Ramsey, A.J. Bouye and first-round pick Josh Allen. This extremely talented group should be one of the first D/STs off the board, though streamers should note that the Jaguars play the Chiefs in Week 1.",

Coach Sean McDermott has an incredible knack for creating turnovers. Buffalo has ranked no lower than ninth in that department each of the past two seasons, and Carolina ranked top-10 in each of McDermott's final four seasons as that team's defensive coordinator (2013-16). If there is a weak spot, it is sacks, as Buffalo has ranked outside the top 25 in that area each of the past two seasons. The addition of first-round pick Ed Oliver aside, this defense barely changed in the offseason, which means a core led by Jerry Hughes, Tre'Davious White and second-year Tremaine Edmunds is back in place. Signing impact returner Andre Roberts added to this unit's appeal. This is a solid top-10 D/ST.",

Ndamukong Suh and Lamarcus Joyner were notable offseason losses, but the team remains strong up front with Aaron Donald and added Eric Weddle in the secondary.

Corey Liuget, Darius Philon and Jahleel Addae are notable offseason subtractions, but Thomas Davis and early-round picks Jerry Tillery and Nasir Adderley were huge additions at need spots. Additionally, edge rusher Joey Bosa will be healthy opposite Melvin Ingram this time around. Add that group to Casey Hayward, Derwin James and Desmond King, and you have a strong unit on paper. Consider the Chargers' D/ST a top-10 unit.",

The Patriots ranked seventh in points allowed (325) and have ranked top-10 in the category 12 of the past 13 seasons. Fantasy's reigning No. 6 D/ST lost Trey Flowers, Malcom Brown and star returner Cordarrelle Patterson but added Michael Bennett to a core that includes Stephon Gilmore, Devin McCourty and Lawrence Guy. This is an average group on paper, but it is led by a coach who always maximizes his talent. As usual, the Patriots' D/ST is a back-end starting option.",

The Colts were 19th in sacks (38) but added one of the league's best edge rushers in Justin Houston during the offseason. He joins the likes of Darius Leonard, Malik Hooker and Jabaal Sheard in what is a solid, young defense. Consider this a fringe starting unit with upside, though a Week 1 road game against the Chargers makes the Colts less palatable as a draft selection.",

The Titans allowed 303 points (third-fewest) and 5,334 yards (eighth-fewest) en route to posting their first top-10 D/ST fantasy campaign since 2008. Despite the improvements, Tennessee ranked 23rd in interceptions (11) and hasn't finished better than 15th in forced turnovers since the aforementioned 2008 season. The edge rush took a beating during the offseason with Derrick Morgan, Brian Orakpo and Will Compton departing but remains in solid shape with addition Cameron Wake and second-year Harold Landry. They join the likes of Jurrell Casey, Jayon Brown, Wesley Woodyard, Kevin Byard, Adoree' Jackson and first-round pick Jeffery Simmons to form a very good defense. Consider this a fringe starting D/ST.",
